            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p n="1">1. He handleth the doctrine of Juſtification, in the 5 firſt Chapters of this Epiſtle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He inſiſteth in the doctrine of Sanctification, in the 6. and 7<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Chapters.</p>

               <p n="5">5. He proceedeth to matter of Chriſtian exhortation to ſundry duties generall and ſpeciall, Chapters 12.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in this ninth Chapter, he beginneth the doctrine of Predeſtination, and openeth that great myſtery of godlineſſe concerning the rejection of the Jewes, and calling of the Gentiles, and herein we have 3 parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place we have not onely an inſinuation of the Apoſtles dear and deep affection, and a ſolemne and ſerious proteſtation of the truth of it; but alſo a ſingular manifeſtation of his moſt admirable love to the nation of the Jewes; (notwithſtanding the doctrine he was now about to deliver) and this is amplified by ſundry circumſtances, as</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the particular paſſion or affection wherein he manifeſted his dear love to them, and that is his grief and ſorrow for their caſting off.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The grief he here ſpeaketh of is further amplified by two further circumſtances, or adjuncts. <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The conſtancy of it. 2. The ſinceritie of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This love of the Apoſtle to them is further illuſtrated by the great meaſure or extent of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that he could wiſh himſelf accurſed and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from Chriſt in order to procure their ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, by the affectionate and honourable mention that he maketh of the Jewiſh nation, deſcribing both fully and affectionately all their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and prerogatives, ſhewing what great cauſe he had to be ſo deeply affected with their rejection; and thus he doth in the 5 firſt verſes of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the Chapter is touching a vindication of the ſtabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and conſtancy of the Lords promiſes, though the Jewes were rejected,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108302:4"/> and the defending of that promiſe of God for the ſtability of it, againſt all cavils and all erring ſpirits, and all humane reaſonings that may be brought to the contrary, and that from the 6. verſe to the 24. The third part is a declaration of that wonderfull and deep myſtery held from the beginning of the world concerning the calling of the Gentiles, and rejection of the Jews, which was a thing foretold though men did not underſtand it, before Paul revealed it unto them, which was foretold by the Prophets, ſo laid down from the 24. verſe, to the end of the Chapter: ſo you have the chief materials generall in the Chapter: of theſe in order, and firſt of the firſt.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle being about to propound that which he knew would be taken very harſh and hard, and marvellous diſpleaſing and offenſive to the Jews to hear of, he uſeth a very patheticall inſinuation of his love unto the Jews, that he ſpeaks of love, expreſſing that love by his inward and hearty ſorrow for their preſent eſtate, and the care that he had for their good, thereby to gain their good will, and not exaſperate them againſt him. And the Apoſtle being to lay down their rejection, uſeth a Preface unto it, that the thing he ſpake was the truth, and for the more force and efficacy of it, he putteth down the contrary, (and I lie not); and he confirmeth it further by an oath, he calleth Chriſt to witneſſe (I ſpeak the truth in Chriſt, I lie not.) And ſecondly, he proveth it by the witneſſes and teſtimony of his own conſcience, his own conſcience bearing witneſſe with him; and this conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence renewed by the holy Ghoſt, (mine own conſcience bearing witneſſe with me in the holy Ghoſt.) And then in the ſecond verſe he delivereth and putteth down his ſorrow, and his grief, and his heavineſſe of heart; and thus he ſetteth out, by the continuance and greatneſſe of it, it was a great ſorrow, and a continuall ſorrow, and that in his heart and ſoul, and not a diſſembled, fained, or outſide ſorrow, but in his very heart and ſoul: there he putteth down the deſire of their good in the third verſe. And he doth expreſſe that by a wonderfull ſtrange ſpeech, even by a wiſh to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from Chriſt for their good, their calling and converſion: Thereby implying their rejection, and not propounding it, for otherwiſe there was no cauſe of ſuch a wiſh to be wiſhed, to be ſeparated from Chriſt for their ſake if they were not rejected; and therefore he deſireth to be anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and accurſed from Chriſt for their good; and then he ſetteth down reaſons, why he ſo wiſhed himſelf to be ſeparated from Chriſt. Firſt of all becauſe they were his brethren and kinſmen, according to the fleſh. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a more waightier reaſon then this, becauſe they were the Iſraelites of God and Gods people, and that he maketh further manifeſt and plain unto us, by ſix priviledges vouchſafed unto them, as that unto them was vouchſafed, the (adoption, the glory, the covenant, the giving of the Law, the ſervice of God, and the promiſes.) Thirdly, and laſtly, he ſheweth the reaſon and ground of his wiſh, becauſe of that people of Iſrael the fathers came, yea Chriſt Jeſus according to the fleſh came of them, and was of their ſeed and line; of the ſeed of Abraham, even the Lord Jeſus, the Lord of life and glory, whom the Apoſtle further deſcribeth that he is God over all, and bleſſed for ever, unto whom the Apoſtle aſſenteth, Amen.</p>
               <p>Now before we come to open theſe words, and to handle them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, I hold it ſit one generall thing be obſerved, and that may be thus grounded; the Apoſtle being about to ſpeak of a thing which would be very harſh and hard, and odious, to the Jewes that they were rejected of God: In wiſedome he uſeth as you ſee, a patheticall inſinuation of his love unto them, it was out of his love, and not of hatred he would have them to know and to take notice of it, that his ſpeech was from the grief of his heart and ſoul, he had no pleaſure in it, but with a deſire of their good; yea, he ſpeaketh it with a deſire to be ſevered from Chriſt, for their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now then herein appeareth the wonderfull wiſedome of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, to be imitated of the miniſters of the Goſpell, and the obſervation
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108302:4"/> is this, That though Miniſters of God muſt ſpeak ſuch things as they have to ſpeak, (that are hard, and harſh, and unpleaſing, and diſtaſteful to the hearers, as juſt occaſion is offered unto them,) yet it muſt be with a ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of their love unto them, and ſo as their hearers may diſcern, that thoſe harſh &amp; hard things delivered, are out of love, and to do them good. Miniſters of the Goſpel, they muſt not be men pleaſers, or daubers, to daube with untempered morter, and draw a fair skin over a foul ulcer, and ſoothe up men in their ſins, for if they ſo demean themſelves, they are not the ſervants of Chriſt, Gal. 1.10. ſaith Paul, <hi>If I pleaſe men, I am no true ſervant of Chriſt;</hi> but they muſt tell men plainly of their ſins, and of their miſerable eſtate and condition which they are in, in regard of their ſinnes, yea they muſt ſet things cloſe unto their hearts and ſouls; and ſpeak ſuch things as be harſh and hard to their hearers, yet ſo as it be with an inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their love, and that their hearers may perceive that it cometh of love: We read in Luke 19.43, 44. Chriſt Jeſus uttereth a very ſharp ſentence, and heavy doom, that ſhould befall the City of Hieruſalem, he telleth them, that the time ſhould come, when their enemies ſhould caſt a trench about the City, and compaſſe it on every ſide, and ſhould lay the City even to the ground, and all her children in her, and not leave a ſtone upon a ſtone, (a heavy doom) yet withal, even in the pronouncing of this heavy doom, he ſpake theſe heavy things; how? the Evangeliſt ſaith (in the 41. and 42 verſes) he ſpake it with trickling tears in his eyes, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his pity, and compaſſion: for, he wept for them, ſaying, <hi>Oh I wiſh that thou hadſt known theſe things that belong unto thy peace, but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi> And in Gal. 3.1. The Apoſtle uttereth very hard and harſh things, he calleth them <hi>fooles, and bewitched Galathians, that they would not obey the truth revealed unto them:</hi> yet in the 15. verſe he ſheweth this was out of his love, he called them <hi>brethren,</hi> which before he called <hi>fooles and bewitched;</hi> and in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. he calleth them little children with whom he travelled in birth, like a mother; and thus are the Miniſters of God to do, in diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of harſh and hard things: they are to deal roundly with hearers, and to tell them of their ſins, and to ſpeak unpleaſing things to their hearers, as juſt occaſion is offered, yet ſo, as their hearers may diſcern that they love them, and that it cometh out of the love of the Miniſter, and out of the pity and compaſſion, and tender care that they have of them; though they pronounce harſhly.</p>
               <p>Miniſters muſt thus do, becauſe their hearers being carnal, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> will elſe take occaſion to quarrel with their affection, and to carp againſt them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they ſpeak out of malice and hatred, and ſpleen, and out of a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered humour, unleſſe they be mitigated with their love, and ſo they will reject the reproof that may be for their good, and not profit by it, becauſe it ſeemeth harſh and diſpleaſing to them: We know a wiſe Phyſitian, when he giveth a bitter pill, lappeth it up in ſugar, that the patient may more willingly receive it. and the better retain it in his ſtomack; ſo muſt the Miniſters of God in this caſe, even in delivering harſh and hard things, (telling them of their ſins, and publiſhing Gods judgments,) lap them up in the ſugared expreſſions of their love, and good will and deſire, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der compaſſion of them, that they may be the better received, and their hearers profit by the ſame.</p>
               <p>This concerneth us that are Miniſters of the Goſpel, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe: </seg>
                  </label> that we thus deal in diſpenſing of hard and harſh things, ſuch as be diſpleaſing to the eares and hearts of the people, with a ſignification of their love unto them, we may, and ought to teach hard-hearted impenitent ſinners, that they are in the way that leadeth to hell, and that if they go on in that way, without repentance, it is not poſſible for them to eſcape the damnation of hell, they are going on in that way, and are ſure to come to hell, without repentance; yet it muſt be with ſome inſinuation of love, and teſtification of it: as we
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108302:5"/> muſt ſay, I am grieved at the very ſoul for your miſerable eſtate, oh that you had hearts to conſider, and eyes to ſee that your miſerable eſtate and fearful condition, and the Judgment of God againſt you; and to beſeech them earneſtly, that they would labour to come out of that miſerable eſtate and condition.</p>

I have given you the annalyſis of theſe words already; Come we now to the general meaning of them: <hi>(I ſay the truth in Christ)</hi> The Greek propoſition, is here a note of an oath; the meaning is not, I ſpeak in the name of Chriſt; as I am a Chriſtian, or by the authority of Chriſt, but by Chriſt; I call Chriſt to witneſſe, <hi>(I ſpeak the truth, I lye not)</hi> Theſe words the Apoſtle addeth, both to ſignifie the ſincerity of his heart, that he ſpake the truth ſimply and plainly, with an honeſt and ſincere heart, without either mental reſervation, or equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not ſpeaking one thing, and meaning another; and ſecondly, to add weight to his ſpeech, to make it more ponderous, more weighty, more powerful, and more prevailing, to thoſe that hear it, after the manner of the Hebrews, who for more weight and certainty of ſpeech, put down the thing in the affirmative, and then denyed the contrary in the negative, as it is ſaid in the 1 Sam. 3.18. when Eli bad Samuel tell him what the Lord had ſaid unto him, it is ſaid, <hi>he spake every word, and he hid nothing:</hi> ſo in John 1.20. it is ſaid of John, that he <hi>confeſſed, and denyed not, but ſaid plainly, he was not the Chriſt:</hi> ſo this is added for more weight, and ponderouſneſſe of ſpeech; as firſt he ſpake it without any colloguing or equivocation and ſecondly, for the weightineſſe of his ſpeech, <hi>my conſcience bearing witneſſe;</hi> here the Apoſtle doth not ſwear by his Conſcience, as ſome would think, but ſheweth, that his conſcience was a witneſſe, and gave teſtimony to him, that he ſpake without collogueing or diſſembling: or that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience did not ſmite him, nor touch him for it; <hi>in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> that is, my conſcience renewed, by the grace of the holy Spirit of God; as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, I ſpeak the truth, my conſcience bearing me witneſſe ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and plainly, and that conſcience rectified and renewed by the Spirit of God, ſo ordered and guided; it witneſſeth holily and truly: <hi>that I have great heavineſſe and continual ſorrow in my heart;</hi> Theſe words are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the literal ſenſe, as they lye, onely the word, <hi>ſorrow,</hi> is a Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, and is taken from a woman that is in travel with child, ſuch ſorrow as ſhe hath that travelleth in child-bearing, ſuch was the ſorrow in the heart of the bleſſed Apoſtle; and for what his ſorrow was, he leaveth it to be gathered, but it may be added, namely, for the rejection of the Jewes: ſo then the Apoſtles meaning is thus plainly, I ſay the truth, even by Chriſt Jeſus I ſpeak it, ſimply and plainly, and with an honeſt and upright heart, without any manner of doubling or diſſembling, or lying, or any manner of untruth in my ſpeech, Chriſt is my witneſſe, I lie not, and my own conſcience beareth me witneſſe alſo, and that conſcience of mine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and rightly ordered by the grace of Gods Spirit, my conſcience bearing me witneſſe and that holily, after an holy manner, that I am poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108302:5"/> with continual ſorrow, and that in my heart and ſoul, for the rejection of the Jews, even as the ſorrow of a woman travelling with child.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the Inſtruction, <hi>I ſay the truth in Chriſt, I lye not;</hi> The Apoſtle ſhewing his ſorrow, doth not here only ſay, that he ſpeaketh the truth, and lyeth not, but ſweareth by Chriſt Jeſus, that he ſpake the truth, for this his particular ſorrow, the point is thus,</p>
               <p>That a Chriſtian man ſometimes may lawfully ſwear, and take an oath, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> though it be not in publick, and before a Magiſtrate, but in private matters of great weight and importance, (as this was) concerning the glory of God; and a private man or woman may take a private oath between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo as it be with reverence, and with a good conſcience; and for this we have not only the example of the Apoſtle, but other examples in Scripture, as Gen. 24.3. Abrahams ſervant ſware unto his Maſter, that he would take a wife for his ſon Iſaac of his own ſeed; and in Joſh. 2.12. the Spies that came to ſee the Land, took an oath of the harlot: and Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan and David, 1 Sam. 26.42. made a covenant the one with the other; and in Gen. 50.22. Joſeph took an oath with his brethren to carry his bones with them out of Egypt: And many other examples, we have to this purpoſe, clearing and confirming this truth, that it is lawful to take an oath in private, ſo as that it be in matters of weight and great importance, namely in ſuch a caſe, as concerneth greatly the glory of God, our own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the preſervation of others; ſuch a caſe as this (being doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) is to be confirmed by an oath in private, ſo as it be with reverence, and a good conſcience.</p>

               <p>Firſt of all, this meeteth with the errour of the Anabaptiſts, that deny <label type="milestone">

Oh conſider it how the land mourneth and weepeth for this ſin: you ſee Sommer is turned to Winter, and why? becauſe of the Oathes of the land, the earth doth not yeeld her fruit as ſhe was wont to do, The reaſon is, becauſe what is more common then for men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to rap out an oath at every word, and if they be reproved, will either flye in your face, and blot or blemiſh you, and ſay you will not ſwear, but you will do worſe I warrant you; or elſe they will ſay I ſwear nothing but the truth, and men will never believe me unleſſe I ſwear: Oh in the fear of God conſider it, that it is credit dearly bought, that is got with the pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And know withal, that as thy ordinary ſwearing hath the devil for the Father of it, ſo without repentance hell ſhall be the end of it, and of thee alſo; thou ſhalt be plunged body and ſoul into hell. In matters of great weight and conſequence, we may take an oath, for the glory of God, the ſalvation of a mans ſoul, the reducing of men from Popery, all other Oathes, as to ſwear raſhly, that is a fearfull provoking of God againſt thy ſoul: and remember that connexion of the Lord, which he hath put to the Commandement, that <hi>the Lord will not hold him guiltleſſe that taketh his Name in vain.</hi> And therefore in the name of God, let us make conſcience of ſwearing, and flie from an Oath, as from a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; For thy tongue is ſet on fire of the Devil, if thou ſweareſt ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in thy common conference; and thoſe that uſe it, labour to repent of that ſin, for it is a fearful impiety, and a declaration that thou haſt no grace in thy heart, but art a very Miſcreant, and therefore in the fear of God, let thy communication in thy uſual ſpeech be <hi>yea, yea, or nay, nay; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is more,</hi>

And indeed, an oath lawfully taken, is a part of Gods worſhip, as appeareth in the two places in Deuteronomy before alledged: it is a part of Gods Worſhip, <hi>thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt ſerve him, and ſwear by his name:</hi> yea ſwearing, upon a lawful calling, and lawfully, in truth, in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in Judgment, it is a reverent uſe of the holy Name of God; it is ſo far from diſhonouring God, that it is a reverent uſe, and a glorifying of God: For it is an acknowledgment of God to be the Searcher and Knower of the hearts of men, and of their ſecret thoughts; and that God is a witneſſe even unto thoſe that ſwear falſly and perjuriouſly, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger on thoſe that forſwear themſelves: and that he teſtifieth to the things that lye hid, and dark, in our ſecrets from men, and therefore God muſt be called to witneſſe the truth, when any truth is witneſſed by an oath.</p>

Now by ſwearing thus, what do you but ſin fearfully? that which ought to be highly honoured in the matter of an oath, you diſhonour God exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yea, take notice of it, you abuſe the things you ſwear by, and put them into the place and room of God, and give unto theſe things what is to be attributed unto God, (as infinite Juſtice, infinite Knowledge, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power,) as if they were able, and of power and knowledge, to know the thing we call them to witneſſe, and as if ſo be they were able to puniſh if you ſwear falſly; a fearful height of ſin: will the Lord ſuffer ſuch a foul ſin to eſcape his puniſhing hand? Will the Lord ſuffer you to place your Faith and Troth in his room, to thruſt him out of his Throne and Seat of Majeſtie? and ſhall not his hand of vengeance light upon you for ſo great a ſin? yes ſurely, without repentance, the hand of the Lord will light fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully both upon body and ſoul, Jer. 5.7. ſaith the Lord, <hi>How ſhall I ſpare thee for this?</hi> as if he had ſaid, I cannot ſpare thee for this: for what? <hi>thy children have forſaken me:</hi> How? <hi>they have ſworn by things that are not Gods:</hi> by their faith and troths, which are not gods: and in <hi>Zephan.</hi> 1.5.

And in this reſpect the Conſcience may be fitly compared to a Recorder, or Regiſter; That as he hath his pen in his hand, alwaies ready to ſet down whatſoever is ſpoken or done; ſo is the Conſcience a regiſter, to ſet down, remember, and record all our actions, and all our words and thoughts many years agone; yea to witneſſe when it is done, as the Regiſter turneth over his book, and findeth the act done many years agone; ſo is conſcience a witneſſe to us.</p>

                  </label> This truth yeeldeth unto us a ſtrong argument againſt the helliſh atheiſts of this time, that do open their black mouthes againſt God himſelf, and ſtick not to ſay in plain termes, that there is no God; this may prove that there is a God, and may wring from them this confeſſion, that there is a God: for why, the Conſcience is a witneſſe of the ſoul of man, and that witneſſe not onely of the words and deeds of men, for of thoſe, men and Angels may take notice, but it is a witneſs of the thoughts of thy heart, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108302:7"/> of thy inward and ſecret motions of thy ſoul: now to whom doth that bear record? not to man, or Angels, they cannot take notice of them, but to him that hath an al-ſeeing eye, and that is God himſelf; and the witneſſe of thy conſcience is marvellous ſecret, it is not known to any, but is a ſecret, and that ſecret witneſſe neither man nor Angels can hear, or receive; for neither men nor Angels can tell what is in the heart or ſoul of man, but the ſecret motion of the ſoul God onely knoweth: for if it were not ſo, the witneſſe of the ſoul were to no purpoſe, unleſſe there was one that knew the witneſſe of the conſcience; for the conſcience ſpeaketh not properly, but onely by way of alluſion: we ſay it ſpeaketh, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no other but God that knoweth the ſecrets of the heart; and therefore let Atheiſts bark againſt it as much as they can, the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that is placed in the heart of man; it is a plain evidence that there is a God: and ſo let this ſuffice to ſtop their mouthes.</p>
               <p>Is this ſo, that the conſcience is thus placed in the ſoul of man, as a <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> witneſſe to whatſoever it is, that man doth will, or think, or ſpeak, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or do? ſurely then it muſt follow, that it cannot poſſibly be, that any man or woman ſhould ſin without witneſſe, though they ſin never ſo ſecretly, though it be in the very ſecrets and inwards of their own hearts, that none can diſcern but God alone, the Conſcience diſcerneth it, and ſeeth it; and taketh notice of it, and will manifeſt it in time; if they have but an evil thought againſt God, his Church, or Children, the conſcience is a witneſſe to that very thought: indeed men preſume upon it, and do account it no ſin, if they can do it in a ſecret corner, and have a dark place to act it in from the ſight of men, as Job 24.15. <hi>The eye of the Adulterer waiteth for the twilight, and then diſguiſeth himſelf, and ſaith, none eye ſhall ſee him.</hi> Alas! though thou couldeſt hide thy ſin from all men and Devils, yet thou canſt not hide it from God, nor from thine own conſcience, that will one day come in as a witneſſe againſt thee, and lay thee open to the ſight of men and Angels, unleſſe God give thee repentance. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of man is a tell-tale, it will lay it open, and witneſſe againſt thee: Indeed I confeſſe, that the mouth of the conſcience may be muzzeled, and ſometimes be choaked, and fail in doing the office of it, to bear witneſſe; or a man may lay violent hands upon his own conſcience, and as it were cut the throat of it, for a time, his conſcience being aſleep, or benummed, for cuſtome in ſin taketh away the feeling of the conſcience for a time: and as One ſaith well, The light of the Conſcience may be ſhadowed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not good; but quite extinguiſhed it cannot be, becauſe it cometh from God, and is of him in the heart: by the hand of God, it may be aſleep; and benummed, but it will awake, either in the day of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, or in the hour of death, when the Conſcience will be raiſed, and awakened, and will then not ſpare to witneſſe againſt thee: or if it be ſo, that thou doſt dye without any ſenſe or feeling of ſin, thou dyeſt like a ſenſeleſſe ſtone: as it is ſaid of Nabal, <hi>his heart dyed within him,</hi> ſo it may be, thy heart may be ſo hardened, as that in the hour of death it hath no touch of conſcience at all: yet know this, though thou dyeſt ſo, yet thy conſcience dyeth not, it is a natural faculty of thy ſoul, it cannot dye; and though it touch thee not in the hour of death, yet the day will come; when the Judgment of the Lord cometh, it will come and appear before thee, and then it will ſpeak and not ſpare; it will witneſſe againſt thee the ſins that thou haſt done in hugger-mugger, and in ſecret, and thy diſſembling, and cloſe dealing, either with God or man; thy Conſcience will not then ſpare to ſpeak againſt thee: And therefore in the fear of God take notice of it, and let this ground of truth teach us, to take heed of preſuming to ſin, becauſe we are in the dark; whether Uſurers, or thoſe that travel up and down from Ale-houſes to Taverns in the night to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin, their conſciences go with them: And in this reſpect take we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108302:8"/> heed of diſſembling, of hypocriſie, of double dealing in the ſight and preſence of the Lord; thou mayſt blear the eyes of men, and deceive them, but thy own conſcience will not be blinded; it will bear witneſſe even of thy boſome ſins; and although it may be mute for a time, yet it will ſpeak, and that aloud too, before the Judge of all the world: Let this therefore work inward ſoundneſſe and truth in the heart, that our Conſciences may witneſſe good before God of us, who knoweth the inwards of thy heart and ſoul.</p>

But their Conſcience doth witneſſe falſly, ſo as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>a deceitful heart hath couſened them,</hi> Eſay 44. and their Conſcience cannot poſſibly truly witneſſe any comfort to them: For the good things they have done, be they the beſt works, or words, or deeds done, that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly can be ſpoken or done, their conſcience cannot truly witneſſe, ſo long as they be unregenerate: and therefore to conclude this point, If thou wouldſt have thy conſcience to witneſſe holily and truly and to thy comfort, never reſt untill thou find that thy conſcience is ſprinkled with the bleſſed blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Heb. 9.14. which is able to purge thy conſcience, and that thy heart is purified by faith, and ſanctified by grace; and then thy Conſcience will witneſſe with thee in the Holy Ghoſt, otherwiſe it is but a deceitful conſcience, that maketh men ſoothe up themſelves, and eſteem themſelves in a holy and good eſtate, without cauſe.</p>

                  </label> is, becauſe the evils that be upon the ſoul of man, are far greater then the evils on the body, though it be Famine and Peſtilence, becauſe the evils that be upon the ſouls of men, they are ſimply evil things, and ſuch as in themſelues do make men ſubject to the wrath of God, and power of the Devil, which no other outward miſery can do of it ſelf: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a mans behaviour therein may make him lye open to the wrath of God, and power of the devil, but the evils on the ſoul of man, do make him lye wide open unto it. And I may ſafely ſay, that the hardneſſe of Pharaohs heart was a heavier and a greater Plague unto him, then all the plagues of Egypt beſides: for theſe are the moſt fearful evils, and make a man lyable to the wrath of God, and power of the devil; and therefore doubtleſſe this we may reſolve upon, that the evils that be upon the hearts and ſouls of men are eſpecially to be grieved for.</p>

                  </label> This concerneth every one of us, to take notice of, and we are to labour to put this duty in practice; and I muſt tell you withal, it is a duty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many of us are defective and wanting, and come far ſhort of; and the moſt may juſtly be reproved and taxed in this particular, that we have not grieved for the evils that be upon the ſouls of men and women: we can grieve for the miſeries that be upon the bodies of men, and outward eſtates, and we can bemoan and bewail them, and ſhew forth a greater meaſure of ſorrow and grief for thoſe, and ſometimes weeping, eſpecially if they be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108302:9"/> our friends, and near and dear unto us, as we are bound unto by ſpeciall bonds: as our Father, Mother, wife, brother, or ſiſter, or friends; or ſuch like, we can ſhew forth a great deal of ſorrow for them; but the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries that lye upon the ſouls of others, though they be never ſo near or dear unto us; few there be that are touched and moved with this evil: to draw yet a little nearer, thou canſt grieve if ſo be thou heareſt thy ſon, thy brother, or thy friend, (near unto thee) prove a bankrupt, or an unthrift, and decay in worldly things; or if thy child, or ſervant, or any other, be ſuddenly overtaken by ſome accident, and ſome hand of God, as ſtrucken blind, lame, or the like, thy heart is full of ſorrow for this: (and indeed ſo thou oughteſt to be,) But let thy brother, thy friend, thy own child, thy husband, or wife that lyeth in thy boſome, be one that is given to ſin, to live in ignorance, drunkenneſſe, ſwearing, and the like, thou art touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing at all with this, thou art grieved for their bodies: but let thy husband be an ignorant perſon, or an hard-hearted perſon, thou art not touched with it at all: we grieve not for the miſeries that lye upon their ſouls, and this ſheweth the curſedneſſe of thy heart, that thou art an hard-hearted perſon, and according to the curſedneſſe of thine own heart, thou reſpecteſt not the hardneſſe of the hearts of others; and it is a plain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and demonſtration of thy heart, that it is not right in thee, it is an argument that thou art but a carnal perſon, and enlightened onely by the light of nature, and that thou haſt not in thee the life of true grace, that ought to be in a Child of God: therefore in the fear of God, take notice of this duty; and learn we to find this in our ſelves, that we be grieved for the miſeries that be upon the ſoul, eſpecially thoſe that we are bound unto by ſpecial bond, as for the ignorance of thy father, or mother, thy wife, thy child, or ſervant, that they will not be reformed, and for the evils that lye upon their hearts and ſoules; we muſt ſhowr down tears for them that have the means of ſalvation, and yet will not turn unto God, yea thy heart and ſoul muſt be pierced through with grief, for thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, even ſuch as live in thy own Land and Kingdom with thee: as the miſeries that lye upon the ſouls of poor men and women, that have not one that is able to teach them the Word of God, we ſhould cry to heaven, and ſend up ſighes and tears for them, and intreat the Lord to ſend forth La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers into his harveſt, they want it, they live in darkneſſe and blindneſſe, and never touched in Conſcience for the ſame, but go on with an high hand in ſin, and this ſhould grieve our ſoules: We ſhould mourn in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and ſeek unto the Lord by prayer, with ſighes and groans, that the Lord would be pleaſed to ſend forth ſuch as would labour amongſt them, and bring them out of the darkneſſe they are in; thus we are to mourn for the known evils that lye upon the ſouls of others: Haply the Lord may threaten us with Judgment, and Dearth and Famine, which we may juſtly look for, yea the Famine of the Word of God: For men that live in their ſins without touch of Conſcience, this ſhould grieve us exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>Now then to ſtirre us up to the practiſe of this Duty, firſt of all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>1</label> If ſo be we be grieved for the evils that lye upon the ſouls of others, it is a plain evidence that we have our ſoules enlightened, and our eyes opened, and are not ignorant, and blind perſons, but have a true ſight and diſcerning of evils; and of the nature of evil things, we are able to ſee and diſcern what is the cauſe of evil, namely ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it will be an evidence unto us, that we are truly ſorrowfull, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>2</label> and that we are truly humbled for our own ſins, if we can mourn for the ſins of others. And hence it is that you ſhall find, that ſuch as have been the moſt notorious ſinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if once they come to be wrought upon, and to be converted, they come to be the moſt pitiful and compaſſionate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the world to others; they ſee the uglineſſe of ſin, and have felt the

               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>3</label> And thirdly, it will be an evidence that we have true grace, and true faith in our hearts and ſouls, not a counterfeit, but a true faith, and that we are truly zealous for the glory of God, and eſpecially grieved for the ſins of others, that cannot grieve themſelves, even for thoſe that live in the farthermoſt part of the world, that have not the preaching of the Word, that live in ignorance and blindneſſe.</p>
               <p>And to ſhut up all in one word of Exhortation; If then we would have a good evidence, that we are not ſuch that have our eyes ſhut up like Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam, but that we have a true ſight, and diſcerning of the nature of evils; and if we would have good evidence, that we are truly touched and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for our own ſins, and have true faith and grace in our ſoules, and are truly zealous of the glory of God, this will yeeld us true comfort both in life, and in death: Let us then never reſt untill we be grieved for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries that lye on the bodies of others, but eſpecially for the evils on the ſouls of others, and ſuch as do appertain unto us, that we be not like ſtocks nor ſtones, but that we mourn for the ſinnes on the ſoules of others.</p>
               <p>Now from theſe words the Apoſtle where he ſaith, he grieveth for the rejection of the Jewes, ſome move this queſtion, Whether the Apoſtle might lawfully be grieved for the rejection of the Jews? it being accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the appointment of the Lord.</p>
               <p>But the queſtion <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> ariſing from hence, concerning our ſelves, is this; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are to be grieved for the known miſeries of others, the queſtion may be, Whether we may be grieved for ſuch perſons, as ſuffer juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for their evil deeds, brought to the place of execution, when the hand of God is in puniſhing of them, for their evil doings or no?</p>
               <p>Now to this I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> That we are to put on tender bowels of pity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration, and compaſſion, towards all that be in any diſtreſſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the puniſhing hand of God in any thing whatſoever they be, though never ſo vile and ſinful, though they be monſters in regard of the outrage of ſin; yet as they be the creatures of God, as they bear the Image of God, and be reaſonable creatures, and are partakers of the ſame nature with us; ſo we are to put on tender bowels of pity and commiſeration to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, though they be never ſo vile or wicked. Thus we find Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel mourned for Saul. Samuel as a Prophet foreſeeing the evil that was like to fall upon Saul, both in the loſſe of his Kingdom, and the loſſe of his life, in ſo deſperate a manner, he grieved for him, as we may read in the 1 Sam. 16.1. The Lord biddeth him no longer to mourn for him; yet he did in regard of the miſeries that he ſaw lye upon him; thus we are to mourn for all, be they never ſo vile, as they bear the image of God, and are men and women like unto us, but as wicked perſons undergo juſt and deſerved puniſhment, for their offences, either againſt God, the good eſtate of the Church, or the good eſtate of Religion, we may in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect be ſo far from grieving, mourning, and pitying of them, that we may rejoyce, and joy in it, yet not pleaſing our ſelves in the ſmart, or pains of others, be they never ſo vile, but for the manifeſtation of Gods Juſtice, becauſe we love God, and the glory of God is dear unto us, therefore we may, and ought to magnifie and juſtifie the Name of God, in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off of ſuch men, as be Jeſuites, and Seminary Prieſts; we may be ſo far from ſorrowing for them, as that we may rejoyce in it, and glorifie God in cutting off of ſuch wicked Imps; as in Pſal. 58.10, 11. <hi>The righteous ſhall rejoyce when he ſeeth</hi> the revenging hand of God upon ſuch; and men ſhall ſay, <hi>Verily there is a reward for the righteous, doubtleſſe there is a God that judgeth on the earth.</hi> God himſelf deſireth not the death of any, (ſo he ſaith) <hi>I delight not in the death of a ſinner:</hi> yet God was pleaſed with the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108302:10"/> puniſhment of the wicked, according to the rule and courſe of his Juſtice; ſo we muſt not delight in the puniſhment of any, as he is a creature of God, and beareth the Image of God, like unto us; but we are to look upon the glory of Gods Juſtice, and to magnifie and to glorifie him in ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, being deſtroyed, that ſeek the hurt of Gods glory, Gods Church, or Gods Religion: For then we are to rejoyce, but not in their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as they are men of the like nature with us.</p>
               <p>In the next place we are to mark, that the Apoſtle ſaith not nakedly and barely, that he was grieved and ſorrowed for the rejection of the Jewes, but doth affirm and ſay, that he had great heavineſſe and continual ſorrow for the rejection of the Jews, his heavineſſe and ſorrow was not ſmall, nor vaniſhing, but it was great and heavy, ſuch as is a womans travelling with child, for ſo the word <hi>ſorrow,</hi> ſignifieth a vehement, great, and heavy ſorrow, for their rejection. Now what was the cauſe the Apoſtle grieved for the rejection of the Jews? becauſe he loved them; for this was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his love, his ſorrow and love held ſympathy and proportion: hence the obſervation is thus, That true love unto any perſon, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
                  </label> or thing cauſeth heavineſſe, ſorrow and grief in the heart upon any known juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of grief, given from that perſon, or thing ſo loved, and according to the meaſure of love to any perſon or thing, ſo is the meaſure of grief, or ſorrow, upon any known juſt occaſion of grief from that perſon or thing ſo loved, our grief is anſwerable and proportionable to our love; the more we grieve for any perſon or thing, the more we love them: this we ſee is clear from the example of the Apoſtle, that was grieved for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Jews, out of his love to them, and this is manifeſt by other places; as in Gen. 37.34. we read, when good Jacob, that holy and juſt man, had juſt occaſion given unto him for ſorrow and heavineſſe, as he thought, for his ſon Joſeph, he thinking verily his ſon was devoured by wild beaſts, as they did give him intelligence, (though falſe,) it is ſaid, that he rent his clothes and put on ſackcloth, and ſorrowed for him exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yea the Text ſaith, that when his children came about him to comfort him, he would not be comforted, in regard of the evil he thought had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen his ſon Joſeph, he grieved a long ſeaſon, and would not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted: ſo alſo in 1 Sam. 20.34. Jonathan was very ſorrowful, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding heavy for David, becauſe his Father Saul had reviled him, ſuch was his love to David: ſo alſo we find, that the good man Nehemiah had a heart full of ſorrow and grief, and humbled himſelf in weeping and faſting, when he heard of the evil that was upon the Church and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, it made him break out into weeping, and humbling his ſoul, Nehem. 1.6. yea his ſorrow and heavineſſe was ſo great, that he could not diſſemble it, he could not keep it in his boſome, it appeared in his very countenance, yea and that ſo apparantly, that <hi>the King ſaid, What is the matter,</hi> Nehemiah, <hi>why is thy countenance ſad, ſeeing thou art not ſick?</hi> Sure I perceive that this is nothing elſe but ſorrow of heart, Nehem. 2.2. In John 11.36. the Jews ſaid, when they ſaw Jeſus weeping for Lazarus, <hi>Behold how he loved him;</hi> they could thereby conjecture his love to him: ſo 2 Cor. 2.4. The Apoſtle ſaith, in great anguiſh of ſpirit he wrote to them, and in many tears, that they might perceive his love unto them, his true and hearty love, and anguiſh of his ſoul went together: ſo that the point is clear, That true love unto any perſon or thing, cauſeth the like ſympathy of grief unto that perſon, or thing ſo loved.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons are; Firſt, from the working and effects of true love: it <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> is the nature of love where it is in the heart and ſoul toward any perſon or thing, to be operative and working; and the working of it is to make the heart affected either with joy, or ſorrow, touching the thing that is ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; and according to the known eſtate of the perſon or thing ſo loved,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108302:11"/> if it go well with the perſon or thing ſo loved, it cauſeth joy; if it go ill, it cauſeth grief.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> The ſecond Reaſon is from the nature of grief it ſelf: for what is grief? ſurely grief may be thus deſcribed; A motion of the ſoul ariſing from the hurt of the thing that is loved; if any hurt or evil be either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, and ready to fall upon the thing loved, or be already fallen, the heart that loveth is ſtirred up to grieve for it, and according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of love, ſo is the meaſure of grief; and therefore we may reſolve upon this, as a certain truth, That great love cauſeth great grief, upon any juſt occaſion of grief for the thing or perſon that we love, that is dear unto us: for the Application.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> The truth now delivered, yeeldeth unto us a ground of tryal, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, touching the truth of our love, and the meaſure of our love, to ſuch perſons or things that ought to be loved and reſpected of us, as to draw this to particulars; hereby we may try the truth of our love to the Church and people of God, and alſo whether our love be true and ſound unto them: Doeſt thou love the Church and people of God in deed and in truth? ſurely then thou art affected, either with joy or ſorrow, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eſtate of the Church, or people of God, if thou heareſt that it go well with the Church and people of God, thou rejoyceſt and art glad of it; if ſo be on the other ſide, thou heareſt that it goeth hard with the Church of God, thy heart is then oppreſſed with ſorrow, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of thy love, to the Church and people of God; ſo is thy ſorrow for any known danger or diſtreſſe of the Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</p>
               <p>Now then, (to apply this to the time wherein we live) we hear, and have often heard, that the Church and people of God, at this day, are in great diſtreſſe in forraign Nations, even our Neighbour Nations, in France and other Nations, are in armes, and are forced to ſtand up for the defence of their own lives and liberties, and their wives and children ſtand upon their guatd at home, or elſe to lye in the field to defend their lives and liberties: and we have heard, and do hear it daily, that many of Gods children are in great ſtreights; that they are beſieged by their cruel and bloody enemies, even of ſuch as deſire nothing but to ſuck their blouds; yea we hear daily, how the Saints and ſervants of God, are Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred,<note place="margin">About this time was the Maſſacre of the poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> 1620, 1621.</note> and murthered, yea many of them in going from the aſſemblies, have had their throats cut, and are knocked down, before they come home, yea we hear how that Gods children are forced either to yeeld to the Pope and his Idolatry, or to loſe their lives: now we hear of this, are we touched with ſorrow and grief according to the meaſure of their afflictions? ſurely then we have good evidence of our love to the people of God: but on the contrary, are our hearts nothing at all touched with grief and with heavineſſe, upon the newes of theſe things? (which is I fear the caſe of many, to give themſelves to jollity and rejoycing, and are not touched with the afflictions of Joſeph) do we hear of theſe things as matter of news, and diſcourſe of them as novelties: if ſo be it be ſo, that now we give our ſelves to all manner of riot and exceſſe, when you ſhould give your ſelves to prayer, certainly then you have no true love to the people of God. So alſo for the glory of God, canſt thou hear the Name of God blaſphemed, and diſhonoured, by curſing, ſwearing, lying, ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldry? and uſe all manner of filthy ſpeaking, and prophaning the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: is not thy heart ſmitten? is it not as a dagger in thy ſoul, and a ſword in thy heart, when thou heareſt men blaſpheme, and fearfully abuſe the holy name of God? aſſuredly then thou haſt no true love to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God: and ſo alſo for the truth of Religion; canſt thou hear the holy Religion of God, deſtroyed and trampled under foot? and that Popery, Idolatry, and Superſtition, is like to be ſet up in the room of it?
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108302:11"/> and when thou heareſt of this, doeſt thou not mourn? but art a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and careſt not which end goes forward? either Popery, or true Religion? it is a ſure note, that thou haſt no true love to the Religion of God: and thus I might proceed in other particulars, but let us learn now to be grieved, according to the known juſt occaſion of grief given unto us, for the Church and Children of God, for the glory of God, and pure Religion of God; if ſo be we find no grief at all in our hearts, when there is juſt occaſion of grief, let us not deceive our ſelves, aſſuredly we love them not as we ought to do. We read in the 1 Sam. 4.18, 19. and ſo on to the end of the Chapter, that old Eli was more affected when he heard newes that the Ark of God was taken, then with the loſſe of his two ſons: and the wife of Phinees, the daughter in law of Eli, was more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the loſſe of the Ark of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then with the loſſe of her own dear husband; for when ſhe heard the Ark of God was taken, ſhe fell in travel, and dyed, and named her ſon, <hi>Jekabod, the glory is departed from Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> yea, ſhe repeateth it again, <hi>the glory is departed from Iſrael, for the Ark of God is taken:</hi> And when the women laboured to comfort her, ſhe would have none, for the Ark of God was taken. Thus muſt we, when the Religion of God is trodden down, we muſt be affected with it: A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace done to the name of God, or a wrong done to the religion of God, muſt affect our hearts with ſorrow; if we would have evidence that we truly love the holy Iſrael of God, we muſt find our hearts affected accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the known eſtate of it, if we have not, we have not in us the Spirit, nor the Life, nor the grace of Gods Children: in 2 Theſſ. 2.10, 11. if we do not imbrace the Religion of God, and that with love and delight, and be more then formal profeſſors of it, we are in danger to be ſeduced of Antichriſt, and to be led ſome one way, and ſome another: we are in danger to be given up to ſtrong deluſions, and to believe lies, becauſe we receive not the truth, in love of the truth: For if we do receive the truth out of love unto it, we ſhall find that our love unto the truth, will be a ſtrong preſervative againſt the ſeducing of Antichriſt, and better arm us againſt the ſubtilties of our enemies, and their powerful efficacy and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; though all the Devils in the world do aſſiſt them, and this defend us better then all the learning in the world; we ſee great Doctours are ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, becauſe though they have learning, yet have no love: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let thy heart be ſet upon the Church of God, and the holy Religion of God, that we may be ſure it is true and hearty love, as it ought to be, that we are able to ſay with the Apoſtle, we have continual ſorrow for the evils upon the ſoules, or afflictions upon the bodies of Gods Church.</p>
               <p>One thing farther, the Apoſtle putteth down his ſorrow with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it (in his heart,) hereby he pointeth out thus much unto us, That we are to be grieved for the miſeries of others, even from the heart; we muſt not reſt in an out-ſide ſorrow, in a verbal ſorrow, to ſay we are ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, and grieved for it; as St. John ſaith, 1 Joh. 3.18. <hi>our love muſt not be in tongue, but in deed, and in truth.</hi> As alſo our pity muſt not be a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal pity, to ſay, go thy way, fill thy belly, James 2.15, 16. and yet ſupply nothing to their wants: ſo that the miſeries of others known unto us, muſt be indeed, and in truth, yea in our very hearts and ſoules, eſpecially for the known miſeries of the Church and people of God; we muſt expreſſe our grief to others, by ſighes and groans, and prayers and tears, as any juſt occaſion is offered; and thereby manifeſt that our grief is a grief of the heart and ſoul, when we ſo reach out our help unto them: And know we, if ſo be our grief and ſorrow be not in our hearts and ſoules, but ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, and outward, it is counterfeit; for nature can put on a mourning ſemblance, and counterfeit grief, and there may be a glad heart under a mourning gown; as a poor man, having a black gown, at a rich mans fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, mourneth not but is glad that he hath it to cover him; but we muſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108302:12"/> have ſorrow in our heart for the Church of God: And again, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſorrow, that is not in the heart, Pſal. 51.6. the Lord loveth truth and ſoundneſſe in the affections, when we have cauſe of joy, to rejoyce heartily; and when we have cauſe of ſorrow, to be grieved heartily: Oh then in the fear of God look to this, that thy ſorrow and grief for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of others, eſpecially for the Church of God, that it be as it ought to be, not in word onely, verbal, but in truth; look that our hearts be diſſolved into ſorrow, and that it ſhew forth the powerful working of it, in ſighes, in groans, and in tears, for the poor diſtreſſed members of the Church; to ſhed abundance of tears for them, that we may ſay with the Apoſtle, I have ſorrow in my heart for my brethren, in their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                  <hi>For I could wiſh]</hi> Or, I would wiſh it: he ſaith not, I could wiſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; but he putteth it down with an <hi>(ego ipſe)</hi> I; I my ſelf would wiſh it: <hi>to be ſeparated,</hi> or accurſed; the Text original <hi>(anathema)</hi> is the ſame we read in the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 16.22. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be</hi> (accurſed, an execration,) <hi>Anathema Maranatha:</hi> yea I my ſelf, ſaith the Apoſtle, could be <hi>Anathema.</hi> Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this word, Expoſitors make much ado, and make divers expoſitions of it, not ſo pertinent to this place. But this word, <hi>Anathema,</hi> in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral acceptation of it, ſignifieth any thing that is ſet apart from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe of man, and is dedicated, conſecrated, and devoted, either unto God, as in Levit. 27.28, 29. They were to ſet apart certain men and beaſts, and devote them unto God; or it ſignifieth things dedicated and devoted unto the Devil; as thoſe things that were conſecrated and devoted unto Idols among the heathen, that were devils indeed, and called <gap reason="foreign">

Now in this third ſenſe and ſignification, is the word here uſed by the Apoſtle, not as a thing dedicated to God, or the Devil, but as a thing dedicated and devoted to deſtruction; as appeareth, in that the Apoſtle wiſheth to be <hi>anathematized,</hi> or ſeparated from Chriſt: for to be ſeparated, is to be removed and ſet apart from ſalvation, purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Chriſt, and from all hope of it: In a word, it ſignifieth to periſh, and to be utterly condemned; for out of Chriſt there is no hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that ſo he might periſh in hell, and utterly be damned there, and feel the pains of the damned in hell.</p>

               <p>And for further Explanation of this phraſe, ſome think that this wiſh of the Apoſtle was abſolute, and actual, without any condition at all: but others are of another mind, to whom I rather encline; for it was not an abſolute wiſh to be ſevered from Chriſt, but it is to be underſtood with a Condition, namely, he would thus wiſh to be ſeparated from Chriſt, and damned in hell, if it were poſſible, that he being damned, the Jews might be ſaved, and God and Chriſt have the more glory: this ſpeech, it is like unto that of David, in the 2 Sam. 18.33. where David ſaith, <hi>Oh Abſalon, my ſon, my ſon, would God I had dyed for thee, Oh Abſalon, my ſon my ſon:</hi> he wiſheth with a condition, (if it might be poſſible) would I had dyed for thee: ſo the Apoſtle would wiſh himſelf to be ſeparated from Chriſt; for the Jews, if it were poſſible, that he being damned, the Jewes might be ſaved; that he going to hell, they might go to heaven, and the greater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereby come to God and Chriſt: For without queſtion, the Apoſtle here in this ſpeech of his, had not onely reſpect to the ſalvation of the Jews, but he had reſpect to the glory of God, and of Chriſt, that Gods glory might be advanced, and his Kingdome amplified and inlarged: now it muſt needs be, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh with a condition; (if it were poſſible,) For otherwiſe, the ſpeech of the Apoſtle had been clean contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to the purpoſe of God, (yea to that purpoſe which the Apoſtle was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withal,) that the Lord did purpoſe to ſave him, which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the two laſt Verſes of the former Chapter, where he ſaith nothing ſhould ſeparate him; and yet now doth he wiſh ſeparation abſolutely?<note place="margin">Rom. 8.38, 39.</note> no ſure, it is with condition; <hi>for my brethren, which are my kinſmen</hi>) an uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all phraſe among the Hebrews, to call them brethren, that were of the ſame bloud, Gen. 13.8. Abraham ſaid unto Lot, <hi>we are brethren,</hi> who was his nephew: <hi>according to the fleſh,]</hi> This the Apoſtle addeth, to ſignifie that they were his kinſmen according to the fleſh, not by the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not converted, though they were his brethren, by fleſh and blood deſcended of the ſame Parents, yet not by grace, or by the Spirit; and indeed the Apoſtle meaneth the Jewes, which he ſetteth out, that they were his kindred according to the fleſh: ſo then thus briefly conceive we the meaning of the Apoſtle, as if he had ſaid, Even I my ſelf, and no other for me, could wiſh that I were removed and even ſet apart from ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation purchaſed by Chriſt, and all hope thereof; yea I could wiſh my ſelf to be damned in hell, and to periſh if it might poſſibly be, provided that I being damned, the Jews might be ſaved; the Jewes who are my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I mean my kinſmen according to the fleſh, according to the bond of fleſh and blood, that they might come into the Faith of the Goſpel; I wiſh it, that the glory of God in their ſalvation might be increaſed: So much for the meaning of the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, here cometh a queſtion <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> to be anſwered; <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the holy Apoſtle did well, in thus wiſhing himſelf (if it had been poſſible,) to be accurſed from Jeſus Chriſt? to go to hell for the ſalvation of the Jewes? this ſeemeth a thing not tolerable: For there is or ought to be, in every Child of God, a holy ſelf-love, and a ſanctified ſelf-love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are bound to love themſelves, above all others, and to uſe all good means for the good eſtate of their own bodies, and ſoules, and that above the eſtate of any other; howſoever as the Apoſtle John ſaith, 1 John 3.16. That as Chriſt laid down his life for us, ſo are we one for another: yet a Chriſtian is not bound to deprive himſelf of a temporal life, for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the temporal life of another, no nor yet to deprive himſelf of eternal life, for the eternal good eſtate of others; did the Apoſtle then do well thus to wiſh?</p>
               <p>Yes, the Apoſtle doth well in this wiſhing, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> even in wiſhing himſelf to be accurſed from Chriſt, for the converſion of the Jews; becauſe in this wiſh and deſire of the Apoſtle; he had not onely reſpect to the ſalvation
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108302:13"/> of the Jews, and their converſion, but alſo to the glory of God, and of Chriſt, and he knew, that indeed the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt, would be wonderfully inlarged by the converſion of the Jews, and the glory of God, and of Chriſt, ought to be procured, (if it were poſſible) even with the eternal confuſion of our ſoules, though we be the Children of God.</p>

                  </label> But it may be, ſome may further ſay, Admit it were for the glory of God, that the Apoſtle wiſhed himſelf to be ſeparated from Chriſt, or to be accurſed, or <hi>anathema</hi> from Chriſt; May a man wiſh himſelf ſeparated from Chriſt, and ſo an enemy to Chriſt, and Chriſt an enemy to him, as the Devils and damned in hell are?</p>
               <p>I anſwer <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> again, the Apoſtles wiſh is not ſo to be taken, he wiſhed (if it had been poſſible) to be ſeparated from Chriſt, not in love, but in puniſhment: he wiſhed not to become an enemy to Chriſt, nor to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of Chriſt his love to him, and to have Chriſt an enemy to him, but to want the fruition of the fruits of Chriſt his love, that is, everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and to loſe his part in heaven, and to undergo the torments of hell, (if it had been poſſible,) yet ſtill to love Chriſt, and ſtill to be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Chriſt. Chriſt himſelf was made a curſe for us, as Gal. 3.13. yet was he not then (when he was under the curſe) an enemy to God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor his Father an enemy to him, but he only out of his love to Gods choſen, of his own accord underwent the curſe for their ſins, to redeem them from the curſe. And ſo doubtleſſe the Apoſtle wiſhed to be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Chriſt, or accurſed from Chriſt, yet ſo as that he would ſtill love Chriſt, and ſtill be beloved of Chriſt, and ſo we are to underſtand his wiſh: and ſo this queſtion is anſwered.</p>
               <p>Now in that the Apoſtle doth here manifeſt his love to the Jews, in his earneſt deſire of their good, expreſſing that in wiſhing himſelf to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and accurſed from Chriſt, for their converſion, and ſalvation, it points out to us plainly thus much,</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
                  </label> That we are to deſire every way the good of thoſe whom we love and are bound to love, and eſpecially the good of their ſoules; we are to wiſh and deſire that it may go well with others, whom we love, and are bound to love in reſpect of their bodies, and outward eſtate, but eſpecially that it may go well with their ſoules, that they may have ſaving grace in their ſoules, and an increaſe of it, and that their ſouls may be poſſeſt of ſaving grace here in this life, and eternally ſaved hereafter in heaven; that is, the thing we are moſt earneſtly to wiſh and deſire in the behalf of thoſe whom we love, and are bound to love. And to this purpoſe we find, that the Apoſtles do uſually in the beginning and fronts of their Epiſtles, wiſh to thoſe Churches and perſons to whom they writ, out of their love to them, eſpecially ſpiritual good things, concerning the good of their ſoules, even <hi>grace and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as Rom. 1.7. 1 Cor. 1.3. 2 Cor. 1.2. Gal. 1.3. And ſo in other Epiſtles they wiſh the ſame particular good things to the ſoules of them whom they writ to, not onely in effect, but in a manner word for word: and we find that the Apoſtles do likewiſe uſually give thanks to God, eſpecially for good things beſtowed on the ſoules of thoſe to whom they writ; as for their faith, their hope, their love to God, and to the Saints, their patience and ſuch like. And thereby alſo they do give to us to underſtand, that we are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to wiſh and deſire the good of the ſoules of thoſe whom we love, and are bound to love, that they may have ſaving grace in their ſoules, and an increaſe of it here in this life, and that they may be eternally ſaved here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in heaven. And there is good reaſon for it.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> Becauſe indeed ſaving grace here in this life, and ſalvation hereafter in heaven, is the moſt excellent thing that can be deſired, or enjoyed: ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace in the ſoul, is proper to thoſe whom God loves in ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108302:13"/> and gives it to none but to ſuch as belong to Gods election: And it ſweetens all other good things of this life, and makes them truly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, without which, they are but accurſed vanities, and vexations of ſpirit, Eccleſ. 2.11. as the Preacher ſpeaks; yea, ſaving grace in the ſoul yeelds comfort and rejoycing of heart, when all other things in this life can yeeld none at all: as in the midſt of trouble, ſorrow and perplexity, and in the hour of death. And therefore doubtleſſe, ſaving grace here in this life, and ſalvation hereafter in heaven, are the things that we are eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to wiſh and deſire, in the behalf of thoſe whom we love, and are bound to love.</p>
               <p>But may ſome ſay, It may be that thoſe whom we love, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> and are bound to love, belong not to Gods election: Are we bound to wiſh ſaving grace and ſalvation to them?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> That they belong not to Gods election, is a ſecret, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, and we are not to meddle with that, we are to follow the Will of God revealed, which enjoyns us to deſire the good of thoſe whom we love, and are bound to love, eſpecially the good of their ſoules, even to wiſh them ſaving grace here in this life, and ſalvation hereafter in heaven.</p>
               <p>We ſee then a Duty that concerns us, laid before us, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> and we are to take notice of it, and to put it in practiſe; it is a duty little thought on, or little regarded by many: we can (many of us) wiſh well to ſuch as we love, and are bound to love, to our children, and friends, in reſpect of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and outward eſtate; we can wiſh them health and wealth, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperity, that they may live in health, and may thrive and come forward in the world, and may proſper in their outward affaires, theſe things we can wiſh them, out of the ſtrength of natural affection, which indeed we are bound to wiſh unto them, that they may ſo live, and ſo do, by the uſe of all good means. But alas here is our failing, and fault, few there be, that make it the earneſt deſire of their hearts, and the chief wiſh of their ſoules; That their children, ſervants, brethren, friends, and ſuch as they love, and are bound to love, may have ſaving grace wrought in their ſoules, that they may come to have ſaving knowledge of God, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, and ſaving repentance, and may come truly to fear the Lord. Indeed ſometimes men (for form and faſhion) break out and ſay; God give grace to my child, to my ſervants, and ſuch like, and God bleſſe them with his grace, and God make them his faithful ſervant; which are good ſpeeches, but this is but a flaſh, and a vaniſhing wiſh, it ends with a breath, and in ſpeaking of it, it is not ſeconded with a careful uſe of all the good means as it ought to be.</p>
               <p>Now then know it whoſoever thou art, thou muſt eſpecially wiſh and deſire the good of the ſoules of thoſe whom thou loveſt, and art bound to love, that they may come to ſaving knowledge, ſaving faith, and ſaving repentance, and may come truly to fear God: and thy deſire muſt be true, ſound, ſettled and conſtant, ſeconded with the careful uſe of all good means, within the compaſſe of thy place and calling, that ſerve to work ſaving grace in them, as teaching and inſtructing them, counſelling them, comforting them, and praying for them, and ſending up thy wiſhes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for them. And to help us forward in this duty, conſider we theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If we make it the earneſt deſire of our hearts, and the chief wiſh of our ſoules, that thoſe whom we love, and are bound to love, may have ſaving grace wrought in their ſoules; we are therein like to God himſelf, and we follow his example: for thus doth the Lord himſelf wiſh to his people, Deut. 5.29. <hi>Oh that there were ſuch an heart in them, or who will give them ſuch an heart, as to fear me, and to keep all my Commandements alway:</hi> as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108302:14"/> if he ſhould have ſaid, It is the chief deſire of my ſoul, that they had ſuch an heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If we earneſtly and heartily wiſh ſaving grace to the ſoules of thoſe whom we love, and are bound to love, it is a good evidence that we have true ſaving grace in our own ſoules, and that we feel the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and comfort of it in our own ſoules: For certainly, they that find the ſweetneſſe of ſaving grace in their own ſoules,<note place="margin">Act. 11.23, 24.</note> cannot but wiſh it to others, and delight to ſee it in others: they that truly fear God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, cannot but wiſh that others did; as Paul ſaid to Agrippa, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.29. <hi>would to God, that not onely thou, but alſo all that hear me to day, were both almoſt, and altogether ſuch as I am.</hi> If then we would be like to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (and a better example we cannot follow:) and if we would have good evidence that we have true ſaving grace in our own ſouls, we muſt be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of this duty, not onely to wiſh good to the bodies of thoſe whom we love and are bound to love, but eſpecially that they may have ſaving grace in their ſoules here in this life, and ſalvation hereafter in heaven, and carefully uſe all good means ſerving to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Let us now go on to further matter offered to us from this Verſe; <hi>For I could wiſh my ſelf to be ſeparated from Chriſt, for my brethren, that are my kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men according to the fleſh.]</hi> We are further to conſider, that the Apoſtle (as I have ſhewed) in this wiſh of his, (<hi>to be ſeparated,</hi> or accurſed, <hi>from Christ,</hi>) had reſpect not only to the converſion and ſalvation of the Jews, out of his love to them, but he had alſo therein reſpect to the glory of God, and to the glory of Chriſt. He could have wiſhed himſelf (if it had been poſſible) ſeparated and cut off from ſalvation purchaſed by Chriſt, and from all hope of it, and to have been damned for ever in hell, not onely for the good of the Jews, that they might have been converted and ſaved, but alſo for the greater glory of God, and of Chriſt: That God and Chriſt might thereby have had the greater honour and glory; whence we are given to underſtand thus much, and the point further offered to us, from this wiſh of the Apoſtle, is this;</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                  </label> That the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt, ought to be moſt dear to us, yea dearer to us, then our own ſalvation; we ought to prefer the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt, before the beſt good thing we do enjoy, or hope to enjoy, yea even before heaven it ſelf; and we are to be willing, rather to loſe our part of happineſſe and glory in heaven, (if it were poſſible) we being the Children of God, then that God, or Chriſt ſhould loſe any part of their glory. And thus it was with the bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in this place; and thus alſo it was with Moſes the ſervant of God, Exod. 32.32. we there find, that Moſes deſired the Lord, if he would not pardon the ſin of his people Iſrael, but proceed in wrath againſt them, and deſtroy them, as they had deſerved by their ſins, that then he would blot him out of his book of life that he had written. Moſes knew that with the preſervation of the people of Iſrael (who were then the viſible Church of God,) was Gods glory joyned, both in reſpect of the promiſes made to the Fathers, (which it was not for Gods honour to fruſtrate) and in regard of the blaſphemies which the Egyptians and other ſpiteful enemies to God, would have been ready (on the ruine and deſtruction of the Lords people,) to caſt out againſt him. Moſes therefore did not onely look to the preſervation of the people, but to the glory of God alſo; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that he was even careleſſe of his own ſalvation, and he preferred Gods glory, before his own eternal happineſſe and ſalvation: indeed, we find not any other example in the Scripture to this purpoſe, ſaving onely theſe two of Moſes and Paul: but theſe do ſufficiently ſhew, that though we cannot attain to that meaſure of zeal to Gods glory, that was in them; yet we muſt aym at it, and we are to labour and ſtrive to the uttermoſt of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108302:14"/> our power to come to it; and theſe examples do evidence to us, that thus it ought to be with us, that we ought to eſteem the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt moſt dear to us, and to prefer that before the beſt good thing we do enjoy, or hope to enjoy, yea even before our own happineſſe and glory in heaven; it ought to be dearer to us, then our own ſoules: and the Reaſons and grounds of it be theſe;</p>
               <p>Firſt, the glory of God, is the end of all the creatures of God, and for <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> his glory were all things made; we live, and move, and have our being from God, to this end principally, to yeeld him glory: and all our thoughts, words and actions are to tend to this, that God may have glory by them, it is that we are taught to pray for in the firſt place, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.31.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, the glory of God is the chiefeſt good; it's better worth <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> then all things in heaven or earth. And hence it is, that the Angels and Saints in heaven, make it their whole joy and felicity to ſing praiſe and glory to God; yea they are ſo raviſhed with the love of Gods glory, that they never faint nor grow weary, in ſounding forth the praiſe and glory of God; they ceaſe not day nor night, ſaying, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, which is, and which is to come,</hi> Revel. 4.8. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on theſe grounds it followes directly and neceſſarily, that the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt, ought to be moſt dear to us, and we are to preſerve that, before the beſt good things we do enjoy, or hope to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, yea even before our own happineſſe and glory in heaven, and it ought to be dearer to us, then our own ſoules.</p>
               <p>A duty, (to apply it and to lay it a little nearer to our conſciences) a duty I ſay wherein moſt of us come far ſhort; for conſider it, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> are we ſo affected to the glory of God, and to the glory of Chriſt, as we hold that dearer to us, then our own lives? yea then our eternal good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and the everlaſting ſalvation of our own ſoules? alas! if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the matter, we ſhall find, that many of us prefer a little worldly pelf, a little eaſe or pleaſure, or a little vain credit in the world, before the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt. Do not ſome, who have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of wealth, wherewith they might do much good, and honour God and Chriſt exceedingly, (as <hi>Solomon</hi> exhorts, Prov. 3.9. <hi>honour God with thy riches,</hi>) they might imploy their wealth to many good uſes, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of Gods glory, and to the furthering of the Goſpel of Chriſt. And do they not prefer the keeping of their wealth, after a baſe, and ſordid, and miſerable manner, before the doing good with it, to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt? and do not ſome love their eaſe, and the contentment of the fleſh, ſo well, as they prefer that, before the enduring of a little hardſhip, or a little pains, or a little ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the name and glory of Chriſt Jeſus? They will rather (as they ſay) ſleep in a whole skin, though it be with a breach, a wound and an hole in their Conſcience, then they will undergo any trouble, or hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, from the hands of men, for doing ſuch things as ought, and might bring glory to God, and might advance the name of the Lord, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſt might be magnified, as Philip. 1.20.</p>
               <p>And ſo for the matter of vain credit, and good liking of men in the world: Be there not many ſo poyſoned with the love of that, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it before the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt? Are not many aſhamed to profeſſe the name of Chriſt and to be ſound and ſincere in the profeſſion of the Goſpel, becauſe they ſhall be diſgraced in the world, and be counted Puritanes? they will not adorn the doctrine of the Goſpel they profeſſe, Tit. 2.10. they will not endeavour to be blameleſſe and pure, and the ſons of God, without rebuke, in the midſt of a naughty and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked nation, and to ſhine as lights in the world, as the Apoſtle exhorts, Phil. 2.15. Though God and Chriſt might be thereby much glorified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108302:15"/> then they ſhall be out of favour and credit with men, yea haply with their beſt friends, (as they account them,) with thoſe on whom their preferment depends; yea are there not many in the world, and amongſt us, ſo far from accounting the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt, ſo dear to them, as they could be content, for that, to part with the beſt good thing they do enjoy, or hope to enjoy; even to part with heaven for it, (if it might be) as that indeed, they will not part with any one beloved ſin, for the glory of God, and for the glory of Chriſt. They will not, for the glory of God, and for the honour of the Lord Jeſus, part with their pride, their vanity, and gariſhneſſe in apparel, their drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, their whoredome, their covetouſneſſe, their uſury, or with any other darling ſin, no, though it be ſo, that together with leaving of their ſin, they might both glorifie God, and alſo enjoy comfort to themſelves here, and happineſſe and glory hereafter in heaven, yet they will not, for the glory of God, and for the glory of Chriſt, and for obtaining of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven too, forſake their pleaſing ſins.</p>
               <p>We ſee then, if we duly examine our ſelves, how far ſhort many of us are, from that affection to the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt, that ought to be in us. I might lay forth our coming ſhort in this, in many other particulars; but take we notice of our failing, by that which hath been ſpoken: and now take we notice of our duty, how dear the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt, ought to be to us; and though (as I ſaid) we cannot come to ſuch a meaſure of love and zeal to the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt, that was in Moſes, and Paul, yet we muſt aym at it, and we muſt endeavour to come to it; and let neither profit, nor eaſe, nor pleaſure, nor honour, nor credit in the world, nor the deareſt thing we enjoy, or hope hereafter to enjoy, be dearer to us then the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt; if God call us to do, or to ſuffer any thing for his name, and glory, and for the glory of Chriſt, Let us be ready to prefer the doing or the ſuffering of it, before the beſt good thing we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in this world, yea before our deareſt blood, and before our own lives. And to that purpoſe conſider we, that Gods glory is moſt dear to his own moſt bleſſed Majeſtie, Eſay 48.11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

And wicked Herod had a long time vexed the Church, and eſcaped unpuniſhed, but when he took to himſelf the glory of God, he was ſuddenly ſmitten by the Angel of the Lord, and eaten up of worms, Act. 12.23.</p>

Look we then to it, that as Gods glory is moſt dear to his own children, ſo it muſt be moſt dear to us, and if it be ſo, and we prefer it before the deareſt good thing we enjoy, or hope to enjoy, we ſhall thereby evidence to our comfort, that we truly love God, and are truly beloved of God; and as his glory is dear to us, ſo we are dear to him, and as we honour him, ſo will he honour us, according to his own promiſe, 1 Sam. 2.30. yea he will not onely honour us with the glory of heaven, but he will give us honour here in this world, ſo far as he ſees meet for us; yea he will give us honour in the hearts of thoſe that hate us, and deal harſhly with us, the Lord will force them to honour us in their hearts: And theſe things duly conſidered, ought to ſtirre us up to be ſo affected to the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt, as that we prefer

               <p>
                  <hi>Which are the Iſraelites]</hi> That is, which are the people that deſcended from Jacob, their father, who was alſo called Iſrael, and of whom they had the name of Iſraelites, and they rather took their name from Jacob, then from Abraham, or Iſaac, becauſe Abraham and Iſaac had ſons, which belonged not to the people of God; but all Jacobs ſons were the fathers of the Lords people, and they rather had their name from Jacobs name Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, then from his name Jacob, becauſe it was a more excellent, and a more worthy name, it being given to Jacob by God himſelf, upon a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial occaſion, as we read, Gen. 32.28. And it being a name of ſpeciall ſignification, it ſignifying, one prevailing with God; as the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there ſaith, <hi>thy name ſhall be called Jacob no more, but Iſrael, becauſe thou haſt prevailed with God, or had power with God:</hi> and hence it was, that Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob thought it an excellent bleſſing, to have Joſephs children called by his name Iſrael, as we may ſee in his prayer, Gen. 48.16. <hi>Let my name be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on them,</hi> on Ephraim and Manaſſeh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To whom pertaineth the Adoption.]</hi> Or, whoſe is the adoption: by adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, we are not to underſtand Adoption by grace in Chriſt, which is proper and peculiar to Gods Elect, ſpoken of by the Apoſtle, Epheſ. 1.5. but an external adoption, in that God did ſelect and ſever the ſeed of Jacob from all nations and people in the World, to be accounted only his Church and People, and to be a peculiar people to himſelf, in regard of which dignity, the Lord calls them his Son, yea his firſt born, Exod. 4.22. yea his chief treaſure above all people, Exod. 19.5. yea his Lot, and his inheritance, Deut. 32.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the glory]</hi> Some would have the word <hi>glory,</hi> here to be underſtood of Miracles, and great Works, whereby the people of Iſrael became fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and glorious. And ſome, of Divine Viſions and Apparitions; but it is better to be underſtood, of the Ark of the Covenant, which was a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Gods preſence amongſt his people, where God heard the prayers
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108302:16"/> and praiſes of his people, and gave forth his Oracles to them; which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>glory,</hi> 1 Sam. 4.21, 22. and hence is the Temple called <hi>the place where Gods honour dwelleth,</hi> Pſal. 26.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>and the Covenants,]</hi> By <hi>Covenants,</hi> is not here meant the Covenant made with Abraham, and often renued, (as ſome think) that is comprehended under the word, <hi>Promiſes,</hi> but rather by a metonymie, the two tables, in which God wrote the Moral Law, which are called the Tables of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, Deut. 9.11. and ſo alſo termed Heb. 9.4. And ſo the Apoſtle here reckoneth three kinds of Laws, which Iſrael had, the Moral Law, contained in the two Tables of the Law, here called the Covenants: The Judicial Law, for the Common Wealth of the Jews, which was an excellent Law, having God the Author of it, and being full of Equity, called here <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the giving of the Law: And the ceremonial law, conſiſting of the Prieſthood, and ſuch outward rites and ſacrifices, wherein God would be lawfully ſerved of the Jews, till the coming of Chriſt, here called the ſervice of God, or the Worſhip of God; for that is here meant by the ſervice of God, the ceremonial Law touching the outward Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Promiſes.]</hi> That is, promiſes of Gods favour: as that promiſe made to Abraham, Gen. 17.7. <hi>I will be a God to thee, and to thy ſeed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;</hi> often renued to him, and to his ſeed, comprehending under it, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes both temporal, as touching the inheritance of the Land of Canaan: And Spiritual, touching the Meſſiah, and promiſes legal, touching life, on the condition of keeping the Law of God perfectly. And Promiſes Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, touching remiſſion of ſins, and ſalvation to believers in Chriſt; as Peter ſaid, Act. 2.39. <hi>The Promiſe is made to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> And ſo we ſee the particulars of this Verſe explained; and briefly thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive we the meaning of the Apoſtle in the words of this Verſe; as if he had ſaid,
<q>
                     <hi>I could wiſh my ſelf to be ſeparated from Chriſt, for my brethren, which are my kinſmen according to the fleſh,</hi> which are the people, who deſcended from the Loynes of Jacob their father, who was alſo called Iſrael, a prevailer with God, of whom they had that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> honourable name of Iſraelites. Which people, God did ſelect and ſever from all the Nations and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world; to be accounted onely his Church and People, and to be a peculiar people to himſelf, who had alſo the Ark of God, as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Gods preſence amongſt them, and was their glory; who had alſo the Moral Law written in two Tables, by the finger of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, called the tables of the Covenant. And the Judicial Law,<note place="margin">The Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe.</note> for the government of their Common Wealth, which was an excellent Law, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God the Author of it, and full of equity. And likewiſe the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, touching the outward worſhip of God, which was alſo an excellent Law, diſtinguiſhing them from all other Nations, in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. And they had alſo the Promiſes of God, touching Gods favour, and touching good things, temporal and ſpiritual, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes Legal, and the promiſes Evangelical, many ſweet, gracious, and comfortable Promiſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now thus underſtanding the words of this Verſe, come we to ſuch things as are hence offered for our further inſtruction. And in that the Apoſtle makes this a further ground of his wiſh, to be ſeparated or accurſed from Chriſt, for the converſion of the Jews, becauſe they were the Iſraelites, the ancient people of God; I might ſtand to ſhew, that the Jews are to be reſpected, and that we ought to wiſh them good, ſpiritual good, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were the ancient people of God: but of that we ſhall ſpeak more fitly, when we come to the next Verſe.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:108302:17"/>
               <p>We ſee the Jewes are here ſet out by the Apoſtle, as a moſt honourable people, endowed with many excellent and worthy priviledges vouchſafed to them, and yet all their priviledges did nothing avail them, they did them no good at all, in regard of Gods favour towards them, and of Gods acceptance of them, becauſe they did not imbrace the Goſpel, and believe in Chriſt; they rejected Chriſt, and refuſed to imbrace the faith of the Goſpel, and ſo their excellent priviledges did nothing profit them, to commend them in the ſight of God, and to make them pleaſing to God. And therefore the Apoſtle here wiſheth himſelf to be ſeparated, or accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from Chriſt, that they might come to be converted, and to believe in Chriſt, notwithſtanding their great priviledges: hence then we are given to underſtand thus much;</p>

                  </label> That no priviledge whatſoever, be it never ſo great or excellent, is available to make a people, or a perſon (wanting faith, and ſaving grace,) accepted of, and pleaſing to God; it is not the greateſt priviledge or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in the world, that is of any force or worth, to commend either people or perſons (wanting faith) in Gods ſight, to make them accepted with God: Rom. 2.25. we find, that the Apoſtle reproves the great folly of the Jewes, who being breakers of the Law, yet held themſelves accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, becauſe they were circumciſed; they ſtood on the outward priviledges of circumciſion, who, (ſaith the Apoſtle to the Jew,) <hi>if thou be a tranſgreſſour of the Law, thy circumciſion is made uncircumciſion;</hi> thou art no more pleaſing to God, then the Gentile: without queſtion, it was a great priviledge to be of Chriſt his kindred, in reſpect of the fleſh: it was more then to be of the Blood Royal of the greateſt Monarch in the world; yet mark what the Lord Jeſus himſelf ſpeaks of it, Matth. 12.48. <hi>Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</hi> as if he had ſaid, What is it to be of my kindred according to the fleſh? is that the thing that makes any one more pleaſing to God? no, no, ſaith he, <hi>behold my mother, and my brethren,</hi> (pointing to his Diſciples,) <hi>they are my mother, and my brethren, that do the Will of my Father which is in heaven.</hi> Alliance in faith is nearer and dearer to me, then that which is in the fleſh. Who ever had greater honour then was vouchſafed to the Virgin Mary, to be the Mother of the Lord Jeſus, yet (as One ſaith well.) had not Mary her ſelf carried him in her heart by faith, her conceiving, and carrying him in her womb had nothing availed her, nor made her any thing at all pleaſing in Gods ſight.

It was the conceit of the people of God, the Jewes, that they were highly in Gods favour, becauſe they had Gods Temple, and his outward worſhip amongſt them, Jer. 7.4. They cryed out, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord:</hi> and is it not the conceit of too many in our dayes? do not many bleſſe themſelves, and think that they are highly in Gods favour, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been baptized, and they live in the boſome of the Church, and enjoy the Miniſtery of the Word, and they have good preaching amongſt them, and they are made partakers of the holy Ordinances of God, they come to the Church, and they partake in the holy things of God, in the Word and Sacraments? Oh deceive not thy ſelf, (whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou art;) theſe things are excellent priviledges which thou enjoyeſt, and haply others want; But alas, theſe things do not make thee pleaſing to God, or nearer to heaven, thou wanting faith in Chriſt, and ſaving grace in thy ſoul. No, thou mayſt enjoy theſe priviledges, and yet periſh and be damned; yea they may be to thee ſeales of deeper condemnation. And indeed, know it for a certain truth, the better means of ſalvation thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt under, the heavier ſhall be thy Judgment, and the deeper thy condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in hell, thou not profiting by them, to the working of faith, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace in thy ſoul. It is not the having of the Goſpel, nor thy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſtianity, thy profeſſion being ſevered from faith and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that will ſhelter thee from the anger of God, but rather make way for his wrath, and cauſe his wrath to burſt forth on thee more fiercely, and increaſe his wrath and vengeance againſt thee. And therefore deceive not thy ſelf, think not that any priviledge, or good thing thou enjoyeſt, not the holy Religion of God it ſelf, nor thy profeſſion of it, makes thee pleaſing to God, and acceptable with God, thou wanting faith in Chriſt, and ſaving grace in thine own heart; Labour thou, to get better aſſurance of Gods favour towards thee, then the enjoyment, and outward uſe of the holy Ordinances of God, even true faith in Chriſt, and ſaving grace in thy ſoul, that is the thing that will yeeld thee good aſſurance, that thou art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, and accepted of him in his beloved Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>In the next place obſerve we, that the Apoſtle doth here freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the honour of the Jewes, and the excellent priviledges the Lord had vouchſafed to them, though they were at that time when the Apoſtle writ this Epiſtle, (and ſtill are) enemies to Chriſt, and to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, yea though they were mortal enemies to Paul himſelf, and did wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly oppoſe him and the doctrine of the Goſpel, taught by him, as he ſaith, 1 Theſſ. 2.15. they both killed the Lord Jeſus, and their own Prophets, and perſecuted him, and the other Apoſtles, yet you ſee he conceales not their honour, and their excellency, but here freely acknowledgeth, that, <hi>to them did belong the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of God, and the Promiſes.</hi> The point for our further inſtruction hence offered is this.</p>
               <p>That the known excellency and eminency of others ought to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and reſpected, whatſoever the perſons be on whom it is beſtowed, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                  </label> we are to acknowledge, and to reſpect that known excellency, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and preferment, God hath vouchſafed to others, be it in place, in gifts, or in the good ſucceſſe, in the uſe of thoſe gifts, whatſoever the perſons be, that do enjoy it, though they be wicked perſons, yea though they be our mortal enemies. We ſee the Apoſtle did ſo, in this place, and thus alſo did David, he acknowledged and reſpected the excellency and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he knew the Lord had vouchſafed to Saul, though Saul was a wicked man, and his mortal enemy, and one that ſought the life of David,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108302:18"/> yet David acknowledged him the Lords anointed, and had reſpect to him, as one advanced by the hand of God, to the place of government, 1 Sam. 24.6. he ſaid to his men, <hi>the Lord keep me from doing any thing to my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Lords anointed, to lay mine hand upon him, for he is the Lords anointed:</hi> he doubleth his acknowledgment of it, that he was the Lords anointed: and ſo again, 1 Sam. 26.11, <hi>The Lord keep me from laying mine hand upon the Lords anointed:</hi> ſtill David acknowledgeth wicked Saul, his utter enemy, the Lords anointed; and thus did the Apoſtle acknowledge and reſpect the eminency and preferment of the heathen Emperours, though they were enemies to the Goſpel, and cruel and bloudy perſecutors, both of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and of other Chriſtians. Yea Paul enjoyned the Chriſtians ſo far to reſpect wicked and cruel Nero, in regard of his eminency in place of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as to pray for him, 1 Tim. 2.1, 2. <hi>for Kings, and for all that are in authority,</hi> and ſo for the cruel Emperour Nero. As Jeremiah the Prophet enjoyned the people to pray for wicked Nebuchadnezzar, by whom they were carried away into captivity, Jer. 29.7. Philip. 1.18. we find, that Paul acknowledged, and that with rejoycing, the good gifts of wicked Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and their ſound preaching of Chriſt, for the matter of their preaching, though corruptly for the manner, they preaching of envy, or of vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, what then? ſaith the Apoſtle; as if he had ſaid, that they preach of envy, or ſtrife, what is that to me? I acknowledge their good gifts, and their preaching ſoundly for the matter; and that Chriſt is preached all manner of wayes, whether it be under a pretence, or ſincerely, I therein joy; yea and will joy: a plain evidence and proof of the point in hand, that we are to acknowledge, and to reſpect the known excellency and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and preferment, God hath vouchſafed to others, be it in place, in gifts, or in good ſucceſſe in the uſe of thoſe gifts, whatſoever the perſons be, on whom it is beſtowed; though they be rejected perſons, yea though they be our mortal enemies: and there is good reaſon for it.</p>

               <p>The truth now delivered, meets with a common corruption amongſt many men; it is a uſual thing with many men, through the ſtrength of the corruption of their own hearts, to diſlike, yea ſometimes lightly to eſteem of that excellency, and that eminency and preferment that others do enjoy, in place, in gifts, or in good ſucceſſe in the uſe of thoſe gifts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the perſons that do enjoy them, are ſuch as they diſtaſte, and like not, for ſome by-reſpects: To inſtance; doth not the wife many times lightly eſteem of her husband, becauſe haply he is a ſimple man, or he is a poor and mean perſon in the world, it may be the pooreſt man in the place where he liveth? doth not a ſervant uſually caſt off all due reſpect to his Maſter, becauſe he is a man of mean place, and of baſe condition?
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108302:18"/> yea, is it not a common thing with many, to deny acknowledgment and due reſpect to the Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe it may be, they ſpie ſome infirmity in him, or becauſe of the meanneſſe of his perſon, he is but a poor man, and a threed-bare fellow, as the world diſdainfully terms him: and is it not a uſual thing with men and women, out of the curſed corruption of their nature, to envy the good gifts of others, and the good ſucceſſe others have in the uſe of their gifts, becauſe their perſons diſlike them? what is more common, then for ſome to envy the good ſucceſſe that ſome Miniſters have in exerciſe of their gifts, in that they uſing their gifts carefully, and conſcionably, do gather or build up a people to God, and in that they are in ſuch credit, and ſuch eſteem in the Church, and have ſuch great authority in the hearts of Gods people? Oh this is an eye-ſore to ſome, and they carp at it; and this they complain of, as Johns Diſciples complained to him of Chriſt, Joh. 3.26. <hi>they came to John, and ſaid to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee, beyond Iordan to whom thou bareſt witneſſe, behold he baptizeth, and all men come unto him;</hi> all men follow him: a foul fault ſurely, and a ſore accuſation: and juſt ſo, do ſome now in our dayes, they complain that many flock to ſuch and ſuch Miniſters, and they envy the good ſucceſſe thoſe Miniſters have, in the execution of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial office, and the exerciſe of their gifts, in that ſo much good is done by their Miniſtery. And why forſooth? becauſe they are Puritane Preachers, and their perſons are ſuch as they cannot affect; all theſe, and many others, are juſtly to be taxed, as ſinning againſt this holy truth now delivered, that we ought to acknowledge and to reſpect the known excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, dignity, and preferment God hath vouchſafed to others, be it in place, in gifts, in the good ſucceſſe, in the uſe of thoſe gifts, whatſoever the perſons be, that do enjoy it, though they be wicked perſons, yea our <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> enemies, and ſo for a ſecond uſe of the point:</p>
               <p>We are to take notice of this duty, and learn we to mind it, as any juſt occaſion is given to us. Art thou a wife, learn then to acknowledge the dignity and ſuperiority God hath vouchſafed to thine husband, as he is thine husband, be he never ſo ſilly or ſimple a man, or never ſo wicked or vile a perſon, for as he is thy husband, he hath the ſtamp and image of God ſet on him in reſpect of thee, and that in it ſelf is good and excellent, and ought to be acknowledged, and and reſpected whereſoever it is found. Art thou a ſervant? then take thou notice of it, that thy Maſter bears the image of God before thee, as he is thy Maſter, and thou art to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, and with reverence to reſpect it, be thy maſter never ſo poor, or of never ſo mean condition in the world,<note place="margin">Note.</note> or be his qualities never ſo vile.</p>
               <p>And ſo, be perſons that are in place over us never ſo vile, or wicked, yet we muſt learn to acknowledge and to reverence and to reſpect their known eminency, and their known lawful authority, that comes to them from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yea learn we not only, not to envy, but to love, reverence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the good gifts of others, and the good ſucceſſe they have in the uſe of thoſe gifts, be the perſons never ſo mean, or baſe in our conceit. It may be, ſome are of meaner parts then thy ſelf, have in the ſame calling (wherein thou art) better ſucceſſe in the uſe of their gifts, then thou haſt in the uſe of thy gifts; what then? conſider thou, that both mens gifts, and the ſucceſſe they have in thoſe gifts, comes to them from heaven, and it is meaſured out by the good hand of God, and it may be, God ſees juſt cauſe ſometimes to grace with ſucceſſe, leſſer gifts above greater, becauſe haply he ſees greater ſincerity and faithfulneſſe in the uſe of leſſer gifts, then in the uſe of greater; and therefore, do not thou envy or repine at the good ſucceſſe, others have in the uſe of their gifts, becauſe the perſons to whom it is vouchſafed, are ſuch as thou canſt not affect, or becauſe they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108302:19"/> are of meaner gifts then thy ſelf; if thou ſo do, ſurely thou pickeſt a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with God himſelf, and he may ſay to thee, as we have it, Matth. 20.15. <hi>Is thine eye evil becauſe I am good?</hi> doſt thou repine and fret againſt my good hand, and againſt my diſpoſing of my gifts, and ſucceſſe in the uſe of my gifts? if thou ſo do, thou ſhalt not eſcape my puniſhing hand: Oh then take thou heed of this, whoſoever thou art; and learn we, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and to reſpect the known true excellency and dignity, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, that God vouchſafes to any, be it in place, in gifts, in good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in the uſe of gifts, vouchſafed unto them, though the perſons that do enjoy it, be baſe and mean, yea wicked and vile perſons, and though they be our mortal enemies, this is our duty, and it is to be thought on, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</p>
               <p>Now to proceed, I hold it not fit to ſtand on the worthy priviledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Jews, here reckoned up by the Apoſtle ſeverally, that would be a longer courſe, and not ſo agreeable to the purpoſe of the holy Ghoſt in this place. Onely from the glory, which the Apoſtle here puts down as a priviledge vouchſafed to the people of God the Iſraelites, meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as I ſhewed before, the Ark of Gods Covenant, which was a ſign of Gods ſpecial preſence amongſt them; I thought to have noted briefly, that which of late hath been largely and well handled in your hearing, namely this,</p>

And it is the Goſpel which brings men to the knowledge of life and ſalvation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of life, Act. 5.20. and the Word of ſalvation, Act. 13.26. yea the Goſpel, and the holy Religion of God, is the very ſinews, ſtrength and ſtability of a nation, or a people, and that which doth eſtabliſh a Kingdom or Nation; and where the Goſpel, and holy truth, and Religion of God is imbraced, there is Gods Kingdom; as ſaith the Prophet, Eſay 52.7. <hi>How beautiful upon the Mountains, are the feet of him that declareth and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth peace? that declareth good tydings, and publiſheth ſalvation, ſaying unto Zion, Thy God reigneth.</hi> And Gods Kingdom is ſtable, and firm, nothing is able to overturn it.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108302:19"/> no, it is not poſſible, let them ſay what they will to the contrary; they pretend and ſay, they are as good ſubjects as the beſt, and would make the world believe, that howſoever they differ from us in Religion, yet they wiſh as well to the State; and they are as good friends to the King, and to the State, as the beſt of us all; thus they prate, and thus they would make the world believe; but their lying and equivocating is palpable: indeed and in truth there is no ſuch matter.

               <p>Laſt of all; Is it an honour and dignity to be of the race or kindred of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> ſuch as have been holy ſervants of God, and to be the children of good and godly Parents? what an honour then is it to be the children of God, and to be born of God, and to be the adopted ſons and daughters of God? without queſtion that is the higheſt degree of honour that can be vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to any: worldly men eſteem it a great honour to be of the race or kindred of Noble men, and great men in the world, but alas, it is but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or rather not ſo much as a ſhadow, compared to the true honour of the leaſt or meaneſt of Gods Saints; They are the adopted ſonnes and daughters of God, the great Lord and King of heaven and earth, they are brethren to Chriſt, heires to the Kingdom of heaven, they have Angels for their guard; all things for their good, and the whole world is theirs; and this honour ought to affect our hearts, and we are to be ambitious in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this honour, above all things in the world.</p>
               <p>Now further, it is not to be paſſed by, without noting, that the Apoſtle here ſaith, the Jewes who lived in his time, at the time when he writ this Epiſtle, were the poſterity of the holy Patriarks, and no doubt they were then able to fetch their pedegree from thoſe holy Fathers, and to prove themſelves to be the ſeed and children of Abraham, and to come of his line, as they alledge for themſelves, and brag of it to Chriſt, Joh. 8.33. <hi>VVe be Abrahams ſeed;</hi> and verſe 39. <hi>Abraham is our father:</hi> yea doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, they could then ſhew a perpetuall ſucceſſion of their high Prieſts, from Aaron to the time of Chriſt; yet for all this they were rejected, and were not the true Church of God: the Jewes now rejecting Chriſt, and refuſing to imbrace the faith and doctrine of the Goſpel, are not the true Church of God, though they be deſcended from Abraham, and from the holy Patriarks, and though they can derive their pedegree from them. See then (I note it to this purpoſe) the vanity and weakneſſe of that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that is uſed by our adverſaries the Papiſts, that forſooth the continual ſucceſſion of Biſhops, is an evident argument of the true viſible Church, and they will needs have their Romiſh Synagogue to be the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true Church; becauſe, as they ſay, their Pope is the ſucceſſour of Peter, and they have had a continual ordinary ſucceſſion of Biſhops, Paſtours, and Doctors, from the time of the Apoſtles; which indeed is a vain brag, and can never be proved: it is queſtionable whether Peter ever ſate as Biſhop at Rome: And the Popiſh Church hath no ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles for many hundred yeares after Chriſt, at the leaſt, for five or ſix hundred years. And admit they could ſhew a continued ſucceſſion of their Biſhops, from the time of the Apoſtles, without interruption, yet that is but a ſandy and a weak ground, to build the truth of their Church on, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they can alſo ſhew a continual ſucceſſion of true doctrine, and that their Church hath ſucceeded the Apoſtles, in truth of doctrine; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they cannot be ſaid to ſucceed them, whoſe doctrine they renounce: An outward ſucceſſion of perſons in any place, without ſucceſſion of true doctrine, from the Apoſtles, (which the Papiſts cannot ſhew) is nothing worth. It helpeth not the Biſhop of Rome to have (as they ſay) Peter
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108302:21"/> for their predeceſſour, and that they are his ſucceſſours, ſo long as they ſwerve from the true Doctrine of Peter, and are become ſuch groſſe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters; that perſonal ſucceſſion (if they could prove it) can nothing avail them.</p>

                  </label> That Jeſus Chriſt, the eternal Son of God, was truly incarnate, and truly became man, conſiſting of a body, and a reaſonable ſoul, in all things like unto us, onely without ſin. The holy Son of God did aſſume and take upon him the nature of man, became true man, conſiſting of a true body, and reaſonable ſoul, and not imaginary onely, yea that he had the properties of a true body, as longitude, latitude, altitude, viſibility, and circumſcription; as alſo the properties of a reaſonable ſoul, as underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will, and affections: Yea further, Jeſus Chriſt took upon him the common infirmities of the body, and ſoul of man, ſuch infirmities as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the whole nature of man, as hunger, thirſt, yea he was ſubject to be ſorrowful, angry, &amp;c. Joh. 1.14. <hi>the Word was made fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us;</hi> that is the eternal Word of the Father, the ſecond perſon in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108302:21"/> the Trinity; even he was made fleſh, which plainly ſheweth the truth of his humane nature. So again, Rom. 1.3. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt the Son of God, ſaith, <hi>that he was made of the ſeed of David concerning the fleſh,</hi> or <hi>according to the fleſh.</hi> And in Gal. 4.4. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>When the fulneſſe of time was come, God ſent forth his ſon,</hi> and that ſon that is made of a woman, even that eternal ſon of God, <hi>made of a woman:</hi> a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Chriſts humanity: ſo in Phil. 2.7. The Apoſtle ſaith, that Chriſt <hi>was made like unto man,</hi> and found in ſhape as man: Now indeed ſome (in ancient time) perverted this Scripture, and abuſed it, to ſay, that Chriſt had a heavenly body, and imaginary body, <hi>(like unto man)</hi> he had a body of an imaginary ſubſtance; but this is contrary to the meaning of the Text, as you may gather by the context: for the meaning is, that Chriſt Jeſus had the ſame properties of a body and ſoul, as other men; as ſeeing, ſmelling, taſting, feeling, hearing, and the like, and ſubject to the like properties and infirmities as we are; as to hunger, thirſt, anger, yea to death it ſelf, as we may ſee in Philip. 2.8. <hi>he became obedient to the death, even to the death of the Croſſe:</hi> he did eat, and drink, and ſleep, and was ſubject unto ſorrow and heavineſſe, yea even unto the death; ſo that that place rightly underſtood, is a ſtrong argument to prove the truth of Chriſts humanity, that <hi>he was like unto us, ſin excepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was needful that Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God, ſhould take fleſh upon <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> him, conſiſting of a true body and ſoul, like unto us; Firſt of all, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the promiſe of God, which he had made, in Gen. 3.15. <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head:</hi> here is a Promiſe made, and for the accompliſhment of this promiſe, it was needful that the Son of God ſhould take fleſh upon him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is needful, that he might ſuffer for ſinne, in his body and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> ſoul, that which the whole Church of God had deſerved by their ſinnes: ſo ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, Heb. 2.9. that he might ſuffer death, (which he could not have done, had he been onely God,) and ſo that he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the wrath of God, in that ſame Nature, wherein God was offended: man had ſinned, and man muſt ſuffer for ſinne, either by himſelf, or in Chriſt; and therefore needful it was that the eternal Son of God, the Mediatour of the Covenant, that he ſhould be not onely God, but Man alſo, conſiſting of a true body and ſoul like unto us, excepting ſin onely.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this being a truth, it ſerveth to diſcover unto us an errour; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> it ſerveth for the confutation of ſome erroneous opinions, that are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the truth of Chriſts humanity, (for it is an Article of our Faith, and muſt be defended,) namely that of the Manichees, and likewiſe of the Anabaptiſts, for they affirm, that Chriſt Jeſus took his body from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and paſſed through the womb of the Virgin, as through a Conduit, or Pipe, and took not her Nature upon him: Beloved, this muſt teach us to renounce this opinion, and not onely this, (which hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by our Ancient Divines long agone,) but alſo the opinion of our adverſaries the Papiſts: For howſoever they grant unto Chriſt a true Natural body, they dare not deny that, but that he was born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary; yet in truth they overthrow the truth of his body: how? in that they give unto the body of Chriſt ſuch properties as cannot agree to a true body: what are thoſe? why they give to the body of Chriſt to be inviſible, to be uncircumſcribed, to be in many places at one and the ſame time, properties which cannot agree with a true body; for ſo they hold and teach: it is a common Tenent of theirs, that the body of Chriſt is really locally in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, under the form of Bread, there is the outward form, but under that bread, there is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Chriſt; yea that the whole body of Chriſt is in every part and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108302:22"/> parcel of their conſecrated hoaſt, and yet not ſeen, nor felt, onely the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, of bread, but the ſubſtance of Chriſt is there: what is this but to overthrow the truth of Chriſt his body, and to make the body of Chriſt to be no true body, but rather a ſpirit? and to make it infinite, to be in many places at one time; for why? Chriſt Jeſus took fleſh upon him, he took our Nature upon him, the body of man, even a true body, and therefore his body cannot poſſibly have ſuch properties as they faſhion: Oh but (by your leave) ſay they, God can make it, God is omnipotent, and he can make it ſo: what God can do, we do not queſtion; but what God will do, let them ſhew it in the Will of God revealed, that God will do it, or and if I ſhould affirm it, that God cannot make the body of Chriſt (it ſtill remaining a true and perfect body,) in many places at one and the ſame time, if I ſhould affirm it, they cannot nor never were able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it; for this were to make the body of Chriſt to be no body, to be circumſcribed, and not circumſcribed, which are contradictories, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories can never agree to the Nature of God, to make a body, to be a body, and no body, at the ſame time, God cannot do, it is contrary to the Nature of God, to make contradictories agree together; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I ſhould affirm it, they cannot diſprove it.</p>
               <p>Again, ſeeing Chriſt Jeſus took our humane Nature upon him, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a body, and faculties of a ſoul, herein appeareth the infinite love of God unto man, whoſe nature he aſſumed, and took in unity with his Godhead; herein appeareth the advancement of mans Nature above all creatures in heaven and in earth; yea above the Angels, being received into unity of perſon with the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie he did aſſume our Nature, and the common infirmities of our nature: From hence Gods children, ſuch as are true believers, members of Chriſt, may gather much comfort: for why? the Lord Jeſus their Head and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour will be pitiful and compaſſionate unto them, when they lye under any diſtreſſe of body, or mind: Chriſt hath as it were his bowels yearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards them, he knoweth the infirmities common to the nature of man, and that by experience; he hath felt the anguiſh and the pain that appertain to his members, in his bleſſed body and ſoul, and therefore he is touched with a fellow-feeling of them, even a compaſſionate feeling of them: we know a man that hath been under any pain, or grief of body or mind, will be exceeding pitiful to any that be under the like grief, and marvellous compaſſionate unto them, ſaying, Oh I have felt it, I know what belongeth unto it, I pity him. Thus the Lord Jeſus having the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the common nature of man, much more will be compaſſionate to his poor members, in time of their Afflictions; and to this purpoſe is that, in Heb. 2.17, 18. that <hi>in all things he became to be made like unto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that he might be merciful, and pitiful,</hi> and might have a fellow-feeling of their miſeries: and in the 18. verſe, <hi>For in that he ſuffered, and was tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he is able to ſuccour, and will ſuccour, all that are tempted:</hi> ſo alſo the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, Heb. 4.15. <hi>For we have not an high Prieſt, which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but in all things tempted and tryed like unto us, yet without ſin.</hi> Doeſt thou then (that art a believing member of Jeſus Chriſt) lye under any affliction, or trouble of mind? remember this to thy comfort, that the Lord Jeſus thy Head and Saviour, having had experience of the common grief, he is compaſſionate, and will put under his hand, and ſupport thee in the time of trouble, and affliction, and give thee eaſe in his due time; it may be thou being under ſome great Croſſe, men will pity thee; do men pity thee? aſſuredly the Lord Jeſus doth much more pity thee, that art a true believing member of his body; therefore comfort thy ſelf, and do not think (which may be ſome ſcruple in thy mind,) that Chriſts advancement into heaven, maketh him forget his poor members
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108302:22"/> here on earth; no, he is touched with a fellow feeling of their miſery; his advancement cannot make him forget thee, no, the holy Ghoſt preventeth this ſcruple, in Hebrewes 4.14, 15. <hi>We have ſuch an high Prieſt that is gone into heaven:</hi> alas may ſome ſay, he is gone into heaven, far away out of my ſight, and as they ſay, out of ſight, out of mind, he hath no pity, nor compaſſion on me; mark what the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, he preventeth this, though this High Prieſt be gone into heaven <hi>yet we have not ſuch an high Prieſt, that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,</hi> (but what?) <hi>in all things tryed, onely without ſin:</hi> though our high Prieſt be exalted to the higheſt glory in heaven, yet this maketh him not forget his poor mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; his pity and compaſſion is nothing at all diminiſhed; though he be ſo great an high Prieſt, and liveth in bliſſe, and in glory, yet comfort thy ſelf, he is ſtill as compaſſionate as ever he was; although the Lord doth ſuffer the wicked to ride over their back, and to triumph, yet he is the King of his Church, and will riſe in Judgment, to execute Juſtice: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he may whip and ſcourge his children, yet he will burn the rod, and deliver his: So that this may be a matter of excellent comfort to Gods children, that Chriſt is true Man.</p>

Firſt, he is over all, he is over all perſons, and over all things, he being Creator over all, Coloſſ. 1.16. <hi>By him were all things created, viſible, inviſible, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities and Powers.</hi> Secondly, he is ſaid to be <hi>bleſſed for ever,</hi> which is alſo an epithet, title and attribute of God; Rom. 1.25. the Gentiles <hi>turned the truth of God into a lye; and worſhipped the creature, and forſook the Creator, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever:</hi> and this holy truth of God hath not only ground and footing here, but in other places of Scripture, Joh. 1.1. <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and that word was God:</hi> even before the world was, or had a being, he was God; yea the Evangeliſt ſaith, that <hi>by it all things were made, and without it was made nothing that was made:</hi> he putteth it down both affirmatively, and negatively: and in Joh. 8.58. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Before Abraham was, I am:</hi> a title and an attribute proper and peculiar to God alone, Exod. 3.14. <hi>I am hath ſent me unto you;</hi> not <hi>I was before Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but <hi>I am.</hi> Philip. 2.6. the Apoſtle ſaith, that Chriſt even before his incarnation, <hi>was in the form of God,</hi> and he <hi>thought it no robbery to be equal with God:</hi> he knew it to be no wrong nor uſurpation, to be equal with God.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108302:23"/> It were no hard matter at large to prove this truth as by the predictions and foretellings of the holy Prophets of God, which are ſpoken of Jehovah in the Old Teſtament; and in the New Teſtament we find applyed to Chriſt; and alſo by the works that are proper to God, and peculiarly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to God, and cannot be, but of a Divine Nature, theſe are given to Chriſt, as to make the world to know the hearts of men, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſins; yea by the many and wonderful Miracles that he wrought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of man; man was not able to perform the like, which his enemies could not chuſe but acknowledge, that therein appeared a Divine power: all this doth demonſtrate unto us, the truth of Chriſts Godhead.

                     <note place="margin">Note.</note>And it is worth our marking, we ſhall find, that the name and title of God, is never in Scripture given to any one ſingular perſon, to any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual: <hi>I have ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you are gods;</hi> but never ſaid, I have ſaid, thou art a god: or if it be, it is with a limitation to a certain ſenſe; as God ſaith to Moſes, <hi>I have made thee a god;</hi> thou art a made god: In my place thou art a god, to Pharaoh. Again, Magiſtrates (in Scripture) are never ſaid to be <hi>God over all;</hi> but Chriſt is here ſaid to be <hi>God over all,</hi> which proveth, that he is the great and mighty God, the King of heaven and earth, he is God over all. Oh but they ſay this title, <hi>over all,</hi> it belongeth not to Chriſt by nature, but by donation, and guift. They are deceived, and the ground they build upon is not a good foundation: For in Philip. 2. you ſhall find there, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the exaltation of Chriſt, as he is the Mediatour; ſo he hath a name by guift, he hath a name given him over all names, according to his humane Nature, but he is God over all by Nature, and that appeareth in Joh. 3.31. <hi>He that is come from on high is above all;</hi> ſtill the Evangeliſt ſaith, he is above all, and over all; ſo that he hath that properly by nature.</p>
                  <p>Now touching the phraſe, the laſt thing that they alledge, <hi>bleſſed for ever,</hi> which they ſay, is never given to any, but to God the Father: it is true, it is uſually in Scripture given to God the Father, yet not by way of excluſion, not excluſively, not ſo, as that the Son, and Holy Ghoſt are ſhut, (to be bleſſed,) for when it is given to God the Creator, as in Rom. 1.25. it is not onely to God the Father, but even therein alſo is Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, becauſe by him are all things created, Joh. 1.3. Col. 1.16. For the work of Creation is a work of the whole Trinity; ſo that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108302:23"/> this allegation, and Cavil, it is ſtill a truth, That Chriſt Jeſus is God, true God, very God, God by nature, God by being, God of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, equal to his Father. Come we now to the Application.</p>
                  <p>I might bend the force of this truth, againſt the opinions of the Arians, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> and Mahumethiſts, that have along time blaſphemed Chriſt, but their old rotten opinions have been ſufficiently confuted by the Ancient Divines of our Church. But take we notice of this truth, to this purpoſe; It ſerveth to clear the Doctrine of our Church, from a vile ſlander and blot, that the Papiſts ſeem to blemiſh it withal.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts are ſo impudent and ſhameleſſe, that they ſtick not to charge our Doctrine, to be tainted with no leſſe then the higheſt degree of Atheiſme, in this reſpect, becauſe we teach this holy truth of God, That Jeſus Chriſt in reſpect of his Godhead, is of himſelf, and is equal to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even becauſe we teach this fundamental truth: they ſay it is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of Atheiſme, and why? Becauſe, ſay they, common ſenſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that he only is the natural ſon of man, who by generation receiveth his nature and ſubſtance of his father; now, ſay the Papiſts,<note place="margin">Bellarminus in prefat. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Chriſto.</note> if Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus receive not his Godhead from his Father, but be God of himſelf, as you teach, ſurely then ſay they, he is not the true Son of God the Father, and conſequently God the Father, is not a true Father; and ſo, ſay they, by your Proteſtants doctrine, you overturn and cut down the Father and the Son in the bleſſed Trinity; and in this reſpect your doctrine is hereticall, erroneous, and tainted with Atheiſme.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, Here mark how abſurd and groſſe they are, in charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this upon us: Their fooliſh conjectures in a matter of great weight and conſequence, doth plainly appear, to be moſt groſſe, and moſt abſurd. In that in ſo great a Myſterie as this is, the unſpeakable, and unconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sonſhip of the Son of God, they would build it upon common ſenſe, and make the generation of man to be the pattern of it; that as it is in the natural generation of man, ſo it muſt be in the generation of the Son of God, there being a greater difference between theſe two, then there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween heaven and earth.</p>
                  <p>In the natural generation of men, we know, that the child begotten, cometh from the Father by propagation, but the eternal <hi>Son of God cometh not by propagation, but by communication of eſſence and ſubſtance;</hi> yea by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of his whole eſſence and ſubſtance: The eternal God beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Son, by communicating his whole eſſence and ſubſtance, ſo that the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father; and ſo it is not in the natural generation, they are two diſtinct perſons.</p>
                  <p>But to anſwer them more properly, and more fully, it ſeemeth, that theſe Cavillers, they cannot, or they will not diſtinguiſh between the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and the Sonſhip of Chriſt, we hold and teach, that the Godhead of Chriſt is of himſelf, as well as his Father, becauſe the Godhead of the Son is not begotten, no more then the Godhead of the Father; but withall, we hold and teach, that the Sonſhip cometh from the Father, and Chriſt is from the Father, as he is the ſecond perſon in the Trinity: but as he is God, he is of himſelf, <hi>God of very God, God coequal, God coeſſential,</hi> together with his Father; this we are to hold and maintain: and the Popiſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are of none effect, nor nothing worth being but an idle ſhift: to make application to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Is this a truth, that Chriſt Jeſus is true God, very God, as we ſee it is, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> Oh then how may the Church of God, upon this ground, comfort it ſelf againſt all the Malitious and wicked enemies, that do oppoſe it: they of the Popiſh ſort, they brag of it, that they are many, that they are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are rich, they are great, they are up in arms, and they will prevail; and their Pope ſhall be upheld, ſay any man what he can to the contrary, they will have their Maſſe, their Indulgences, Trentals, and Dirges, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108302:24"/> uphold the Church of Rome, and advance it, in deſpight of all that ſay nay; Even that Antichriſtian Whore of Babylon, and Synagogue of Rome, they will be advanced again in this Land? ſee how faſt they hold a lye, in their right hand, What can they do againſt the Lord Jeſus, the Head of his Church? <hi>who is true God, very God, the mighty God,</hi> Eſay 9.6. they may oppoſe him and his Kingdome, but can they paralel, and match his power? they bend their force againſt the Church of Chriſt, but they ſhall not prevail, for the Church of Chriſt is knit unto Chriſt, who is the eternal and everliving God, of infinite power, able with the breath of his mouth, to blow all theſe enemies of the Church of God into hell, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Church of Chriſt is knit unto Chriſt, and liveth in the life of Chriſt, ſtandeth in the ſtrength of Chriſt, it ſtandeth in the ſtrength of him that is the Creator of all the world, can then the enemies of it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to the ſubverſion of it? they wreſtle againſt heaven, and the God of heaven and earth; for with him hath the Church combination: what then can they do againſt this bond and knot of unanimity, who ever fought againſt him, and proſpered? did ever any man lift up his hand againſt heaven, and proſper? no ſurely.</p>
                  <p>Again, this may not onely yeeld matter of comfort to the Church of God in general, but to every true member of it in particular; the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this, that Chriſt is <hi>true God, and very God,</hi> may yeeld matter of comfort to all that in Chriſt: for why? they are knit to him, who is the ever ſpringing Fountain, the tree that bloſſometh comfort, who is able to take them out of his hand? neither hell, death, nor the devil, with all his Inſtruments: And further, this may chear thee up with this comfort, that thou art one with him, in whom is found all fulneſſe and perfection, not onely of power, but of grace, and mercy, and favour, and meekneſſe, and loving kindneſſe, they are knit unto him who is not only able to help them, but willing to help, and will never ſuffer them to periſh; it is the very argument of comfort which the Lord hath given unto us, Joh. 10.30. <hi>I and my Father are one:</hi> in the Verſe before, ſaith he, <hi>none ſhall be able to pluck them out of my hand;</hi> then he ſubjoyneth, <hi>I and my Father are one;</hi> one in ſubſtance, one in power, none ſhall be able to pluck them out of my hand: And indeed it is no marvel, that the Papiſts, that teach that deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Doctrine, (of doubting of ſalvation, that a man cannot have any certain hope of ſalvation, but muſt live in ſuſpence of it,) it is no marvel that they teach, that Chriſt Jeſus is not God of himſelf, for theſe two things do well ſuit and jump together; we muſt doubt of ſalvation, becauſe Chriſt is not true God of himſelf: a falſe aſſertion. But let us learn to know, that Chriſt Jeſus is very God, and it will yeeld us matter of comfort, both in life and in death; we are knit unto him who is full of power able to defend us againſt all oppoſitions, he will bring us to the poſſeſſion or life and glory in heaven, even to the ſame glory in heaven where he is, even at the end of the world, when all creatures ſhall have their change, then will the Lord Jeſus ſhew his glory, and beſtow it upon thoſe that are his true members, he will ſuffer none of them to periſh, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have believed, and I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him againſt that day.</hi> I have laid up my reward in the hands of him that will never fail me, but ſurely preſerve and keep it for me.</p>

                     </label> in a particular point need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be known, and that is this; That the fulneſſe of merit is found only in Chriſt, and in him alone and no other, the merit of life, and of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is properly in Chriſt; he is the proper ſubject of all merit of life and ſalvation, onely the works of Chriſt are meritorious, his holy ſufferings, and his holy actions, theſe are meritorious, and none elſe; the work of no man or woman upon the face of the earth, though the members of Chriſt, are not meritorious, none but Chriſts: and why? becauſe he is God and Man only, and alone in one perſon. The Papiſts, the enemies of Gods truth, think they have ſufficient ground for the merit of true believers, from the union between Chriſt and true Believers, becauſe true believers are one with Chriſt by faith, and make one myſtical body, (as they do indeed) and are knit by faith, and the Spirit, and becauſe they are thus combined to Chriſt by a myſtical union, therefore the Papiſts think, they have ſufficient ground to prove the merit of the good works of true believers, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this union they are meritorious. But their ground faileth them; it followeth not, that becauſe true believers are one with Chriſt, that therefore their good works do merit, for true believers are knit to Chriſt myſtically, not perſonally, for Chriſt and a believer are two diſtinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; though they be joyned to Chriſt by faith, and the Spirit, it is not perſonally: now perſonal union is the ground of merit in Chriſt himſelf, and the perſon that muſt merit and deſerve life and ſalvation, muſt be more then a mere man, the Manhood of Chriſt, apart, and by it ſelf conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, meriteth nothing; but as it is received into unity of perſon with the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108302:25"/> Son of God: ſo that the perſonal union of Chriſt is a ground of merit; for if Adam had ſtood in his innocency, he could not have merited a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtate to himſelf, becauſe he was but mere man; ſo then theſe enemies of the truth, they muſt prove, (which they can never do) that true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are one with Chriſt, by perſonal union, before they can conclude the merit of good works, and that becauſe of that myſtical union they are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious: but to make application to our ſelves.</p>

Now the Divine and humane nature of Chriſt being knit together into one perſon, they make a perfect Mediatour, by <hi>whom we have acceſſe to the throne of grace,</hi> with comfort, he is God and Man in one perſon, and ſo we may approach with comfort; yea by this means, we believing in Chriſt, we come to be partakers of the ſufficiency and grace of the merit of Chriſt, and they appertain unto us, yea we being one by faith, with the Manhood of Chriſt, we come to be made one with the Godhead, and ſo to have acceſs unto God who is the fountain of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: this is a matter of excellent comfort.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is further to be obſerved, that the Apoſtle doth not reſt in deſcribing of Chriſt to be <hi>God over all,</hi> but addeth further, <hi>bleſſed for ever,</hi> he breaketh out into an addition of praiſe and giving glory to the name of Chriſt, and magnifying of him; that he is for ever, in all ages; and in all times, to be bleſſed, praiſed, magnified, and glorified, and he ſubjoyneth to this, the word <hi>Amen;</hi> thereby ſignifying the inward aſſent of his heart, <hi>Amen:</hi> for the word, <hi>Amen,</hi> is not here <hi>(vox optantis)</hi> a word of wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but <hi>(vox approbantis, et vox affirmantis,)</hi> a word of approving, and a word of affirming; certainly he is ſo, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Apoſtle having in the Verſes foregoing, in the five Verſes precedent, expreſſed the grief and ſorrow of his heart, for the Jews rejection, (who were his brethren according to the fleſh,) yet not expreſſing their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, but onely intimating of it, and leaving it to be concluded and gathered, in this ſixth Verſe; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth upon the ſecond part of the Chapter, and herein he falleth upon a defence of Gods Promiſe, proving it to be firm and ſtable, though the Jewes be rejected: and he defendeth the ſtability of it, both againſt the Objections of the Iewes, and againſt the humane reaſonings of fleſh and blood, that might be brought to the contrary, from the ſixth verſe to the 24. And firſt of all, the Apoſtle clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Lord from inconſtancy, from the ſixth verſe to the 14. Secondly, he cleareth God from iniquity and injuſtice, from the 14 verſe to the 19. Thirdly, he cleareth God from cruelty, from the 19 verſe, to the 24.</p>
               <p>Now in this ſixth Verſe, firſt of all the Apoſtle putteth down a preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Objection that the Jewes might make, in the firſt words of the Verſe; for this they might object <label type="milestone">

                  </label> and ſay.</p>
               <p>If ſo be we, that are the ſons of Abraham, be rejected and caſt off, (as you Paul ſeem to intimate, and imply in your complaining,) ſurely then the Word of God unto Abraham, and unto his ſeed, ſhould be voyd, and of none effect; <label type="milestone">

                  </label> therefore you are deceived, we are not rejected.</p>
               <p>Now this our Apoſtle preventeth, and meeteth withal, by denying their conſequence, and ſhewing that it maketh not the Word of God voyd, and of none effect, if the Jews (coming of Abraham) for the greateſt part be rejected; no, ſaith the Apoſtle, this is no good conſequence, though the Jewes for the body of them, and generality be rejected, to ſay that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God is fruſtrate: then to this denyal of their conſequent, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth a reaſon of it, why it is ſo, (that though the Jewes be rejected, yet the Word of God is not void,) becauſe many of the Iſraelites, of the body of the Iſraelites, and of the ſeed of Abraham, they are not ſuch to whom the Promiſe belongeth; why ſo? becauſe they are not true Iſraelites, they are not the Iſrael of God, they are Iſraelites by the fleſh, by carnal gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108302:26"/> they deſcended of the Loynes of Abraham, but they are not Gods choſen and elected ſeed of Abraham; and therefore the Word of God is ſtable, notwithſtanding: and this the Apoſtle propoundeth in the latter end of the ſixth verſe, <hi>for they are not all true Iſraelites, that are of Iſrael:</hi> and in the beginning of the ſeventh verſe, <hi>all they are not the children of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the ſeed of Abraham;</hi> and this the Apoſtle amplifieth to the 14. Verſe.</p>
               <p>But come we to the opening of the ſixth verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Notwithſtanding]</hi> As if he had ſaid, Howſoever the Jews do cavil and object, that if they be rejected, Gods Word taketh no effect, (it cannot be) it is ſimply, and abſolutely impoſſible, though they mutter againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>that the word of God]</hi> By the Word of God here, we are to underſtand not the legal Covenant, the word of the Law, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not here of them, as they ſought ſalvation by the works of the Law, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe thereof legall, they were ſo rejected in all times, even before this kind of rejection did befall them, they were rejected by the legal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in all ages; and the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of that in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>But by the Word of God, here, we are to underſtand the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Gen. 17.7. where God ſaith, he would be <hi>Abrahams God, and the God of his ſeed.</hi> In which promiſe, God doth promiſe a perpetual being, with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and his ſeed for ever, and not only with temporal bleſſings, but with bleſſings belonging unto life and ſalvation, namely the ſpiritual ſeed of Abraham, the children of Abraham after a ſpiritual ſenſe, meaning the choſen of God, them he would be with, to guide and direct his elect ſeed, thoſe that ſhould believe in God, as Abraham their Father did, whether Jewes or Gentiles, for we may ſee in the courſe and tenour of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that all that came of Abraham were not bleſſed with this heavenly bleſſing, as Iſhmael, and Eſau, but the elect of God, to thoſe the Promiſe was made.</p>

                  <hi>ſhould take no effect,]</hi> Or ſhould fall to the ground, or fail of the end, for which it is appointed; for then when a promiſe is made, and not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, it falleth to the ground, it is unſtable, and of none effect, it attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the appointed end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>for all they are not Iſraelites, that are of Iſrael.]</hi> By <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> (in the firſt place,) we are to underſtand the true Iſraelites, Iſraelites indeed, and not in name only, Joh. 1.47. ſuch as was Nathaniel, <hi>behold a true Iſraelite, one in whom there was no guile;</hi> ſo that by Iſrael, is meant the elect of God, the true Iſraelites among the Jewes: and by Iſrael, in the ſecond place, we are to underſtand Jacob, individually, who was the Father of the Patriarks, and was called Iſrael, becauſe of his prevailing with God, thoſe that came of his race and line, according to the fleſh, and according to the courſe of Nature, that is to be of Iſrael; then thus conceive we the Apoſtles meaning,
<q>Howſoever the Jews mutter and murmur, and object againſt it, and ſeem to be much diſcontented that they are rejected, and that if they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, the Word of God unto Abraham faileth, and cometh to no effect, yet, ſaith the Apoſtle, it cannot be, it is altogether impoſſible, and can never ſo be, that the Word of promiſe made unto Abraham, and unto his ſeed, (wherein God did promiſe to bleſſe Abraham, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, temporally, ſpiritually, and eternally,) that this word of promiſe, made to the ſpiritual ſeed of Abraham, to the elect, ſhould be fruſtrate, and not performed, it is impoſſible, ſaith the Apoſtle: For, ſaith he, I muſt tell you, that the Promiſe was not made unto all Iſrael, which came of Iſrael, by natural generation, they are not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108302:27"/> all true Iſraelites, but to the elect of God, true believers, thoſe that believe in God, (as Abraham did) ſo that though they be rejected, (for the body of them) yet the promiſe is effectual.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Come we now to the Doctrines. And firſt of all, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, notwithſtanding it cannot be, that the Word of God ſhould be of no effect, it is altogether impoſſible, that the Word of God ſhould be void and of none effect: Now then from hence the obſervation is this,</p>

                  </label> That the Promiſes of God unto us, they are moſt firm, they cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be fruſtrate and unſtable, and of none effect, it cannot be that any promiſe of God, either concerning good things of this life, or of the life to come, ſhould fall to the ground, and not be accompliſhed, to whom it belongeth, it is impoſſible, but that they ſhould be accompliſhed and made good unto thoſe that have title to them, whatſoever ſtandeth in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt them, or gainſayeth them; For the further confirmation of this point, read Matth. 5.18. the Lord Jeſus ſpeaking of the Law of God, and thereby meaning the whole Word of God, he maketh it more firm and ſtable, then the whole frame of heaven and earth; <hi>heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away,</hi> (they ſhall periſh,) but not one jot or tittle of the Law, ſhall eſcape unfulfilled, every tittle of the Word of God, whether promiſe, mercy, threatning, or Judgment, and eſpecially the Promiſes, it ſhall not eſcape unfulfilled, and in 2 Sam. 2.28. we read, the Lord having promiſed to David to build him a houſe, David doth aſſuredly reſt, upon the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it, and he groundeth his aſſurance thus: For why? thou are God, and thou canſt not change, thou art moſt true: and Rom. 3.3, 4. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh thus of the Jewes, Though ſome of the Jewes do not believe, ſhall their unbelief make the Word and Promiſe of God of none effect? <hi>God forbid; Let God be true, and every man a lyar;</hi> God is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true: and in Joſh. 23.15. ſaith Joſhua, <hi>Now all things are come unto you, which the Lord your God hath promiſed:</hi> ſo in Act. 13.32, 33.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108302:27"/> things are fulfilled as they are propounded; they are propounded conditionally, with the condition of obedience, and with the excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Croſſe; if his children do fear, and obey him, or if otherwiſe the Lord ſee it good, to exerciſe them with ſome croſſe, or ſome affliction, and therefore if that many of the children of God do not enjoy the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, it is becauſe the Lord is pleaſed to chaſtiſe them for their ſinnes, and he is pleaſed ſo to do for their good; becauſe the Lord ſeeth it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and fitter for them, to be exerciſed with afflictions, and yet the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God are fulfilled, according to the tenour that it is made, unto them; ſo they are fulfilled with condition of obedience, and exception of the Croſſe, Pſal. 34.10. Gods Children ſhall want nothing (that God hath promiſed,) that he ſeeth to be good, concerning their temporall eſtate, or the good eſtate in the life to come, thou ſhalt want nothing: now for the Application of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, this truth that you have here delivered, That the Promiſes <label type="milestone">

               <p>This truth, in the ſecond place, (That all Gods Promiſes are certain,) <label type="milestone">

Titus 1.2.

                  <p>That the Word of God either promiſing mercy, or threatning judgment, or teaching any duty, being miſunderſtood, and miſapplyed, is not the true, profitable, and comfortable Word of God, to thoſe that ſo miſunderſtand it, and miſ-apply it: in 2 Tim. 2. we find, that the Apoſtle having exhorted

                  <p>And indeed, though the Scripture be in it ſelf, the Will and Wiſdome of God revealed unto us, and though it be true, that God ſpeaketh unto us in and by the ſame; yet the Word of God miſ-underſtood and miſ-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, it is not the word of God, neither doth God ſpeak unto us; (and as One ſaith well,) the word of God fooliſhly perverted, and underſtood, it is not the word of God to him that ſo underſtandeth it, and therefore cannot be truly profitable; and comfortable unto him: for the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108302:29"/> hold and teach, That the viſible Church is the body of Chriſt Jeſus, and all the members of the viſible Church, they are members of the myſtical body of Chriſt, they are partakers of the Spirit of Chriſt, of the life of Chriſt, and the grace of Chriſt; Surely then it muſt needs follow, that all the members of the viſible Church are Gods children, and heires of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea then Cain, and Iſhmael, and Eſau, and Saul, and Judas, they were the children of God, and have obtained ſalvation. If this were true, that all that are partakers of the viſible Church, are members of Chriſt, and heires of ſalvation, it were eaſie to prove, that theſe men were in the viſible Church, and of the viſible Church, and therefore by this reaſon are ſaved: but how falſe it is, to think that theſe men have obtained ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, any man that hath been exerciſed in the truth may eaſily ſee it; they are miſtaken in the Tenent, and the ground of their error is this; Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they find in Scripture ſpoken of the inviſible Church, the Catholike Church, (ſeen by the eye of faith,) they apply to the viſible Church; as it is ſaid, that the Church of God is a holy Nation, <hi>a peculiar Prieſthood,</hi> they apply it to the viſible Church; and their definition is a hoch poch, a mingling of the properties of the inviſible Church, and the viſible Church together, and an appropriating of them to the viſible Church; this is common both in their Writings and Conferences.</p>
                  <p>But come we now to lay the truth delivered a little nearer to our ſelves; Is it ſo, that all that live in the boſome of the Church, are not members of the true Church of God? Upon this ground learn we to take heed of a ſtrong deluſion, that deludeth thouſands in the world: Many in the world have this conceit, and are ſtrongly poſſeſſed with it; that (becauſe they have been bred and born in the viſible Church, they breathe in it, and joyn with it, and make the ſame profeſſion that we do, they partake in the holy Ordinances of God, they come to the Miniſtery of the Word, they have been partakers of the holy things of God, the Word, the Sacraments, they come to the Table of the Lord,) therefore certainly they are true Members of the Church of God, they are Chriſtians, true Chriſtians, and who ſhall ſay to the contrary? and yet we ſhall find theſe men that thus believe their phantaſies, they are ignorant of God, and of the truth of God, and of the Word of God; yea many of them, though they be old men and women, underſtand not the grounds of Catechiſme, nor the Fundamental points of Religion; their hearts are full of unbelief, and of Covetouſneſſe, and of diſordered paſſions, of pride, of luſt, of envy, and anger, they perform good duties in publick, careleſly both in publick and in private, never care to examine how they thrive in grace, and goodneſſe; no not ſo much as perform the duty of prayer; or if they do, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it cuſtomarily, and with dull and dead hearts, they are aſleep in hearing the Word, and very untoward in performing of holy duties, and yet they hold themſelves to be in very good caſe, they are good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; why? do they not come to the holy Word and Sacraments? and yet are ignorant of the grounds of Catechiſme.</p>
                  <p>The truth now delivered, maketh known unto you, that you are in the wrong, yea, in the caſe of Judas and Saul, they were in as good caſe as thou art: men may joyn themſelves to the Church, even to the viſible Church of God, and may participate in all the holy Ordinances of God, and yet be no true members of the Church of God; and therefore take we heed of deceiving our ſelves, and be ſtirred up to labour not to reſt in this formality; labour to find your ſelves not only in the viſible Church, and profeſſe the ſame truth, but that we find our ſelves to be true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſuch as know God, and obey the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; for the Apoſtle telleth us, 2 Theſſal. 1.8. that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come <hi>in flaming fire, rendring vengeance upon all that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of

                  <p>Oh then labour we to perform holy duties, not to pleaſe men, or to pleaſe our ſelves, but out of obedience to God, not to cloke and cover ſin, and to ſay, for breaking the Sabbath, what? is it ſo great a matter to ſet things in order againſt the next day?

Iſhmael was of Abraham, as well as Iſaac, he was his ſon, yet onely Iſaac was the true ſeed, and the true ſon of Abraham, therefore all that are of Abrahams ſeed, by carnal generation, are not the true ſeed of Abraham, children of God.</p>
               <p>But now if any ſhould object and ſay, If Iſhmael was the ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, then Iſhmael was his child. It is true, but how? according to the fleſh, the child of the fleſh: verſe the eighth; but Iſaac onely was the child of the promiſe; this is alſo confirmed by a teſtimony of Scripture in the ninth verſe; thus we ſee then the Analyſis of the verſe: Come we now to the meaning of the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>neither are they all children:]</hi> That is, neither are they all children of God, children of Abraham, to whom God made the promiſe of life, and of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called.]</hi> This is a place of Scripture cited out of Gen. 21.12. where God ſpeaketh unto Abraham to his comfort, againſt his heavineſſe, becauſe he was grieved exceedingly, that he ſhould caſt forth his ſon Iſhmael, and Hagar his mother; and theſe words carry this ſenſe, Be not grieved, Abraham, to caſt out Iſhmael, and his mother, but do as Sarah thy wife would have thee, for I tell thee, that Iſhmael thy ſon, ſhall not be thy ſon and heir, but Iſaac is the child in whom I will make good my promiſe, concerning righteouſneſſe, life, and ſalvation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be not grieved to caſt out Iſhmael, for Iſaac is thine heir; So then thus briefly conceive we the meaning of the Apoſtle,
<q>Neither are they all the children of God, or of Abraham, to whom God hath promiſed ſalvation, that come of Abraham, according to the fleſh; for I tell thee, (ſaith the Apoſtle,) in the name of God, Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael thy ſon ſhall not be thine heir, but Iſaac is the ſon of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and in him will I fulfill, ſaith the Lord, the promiſe of grace, life, and ſalvation.</q>

               <p>Come we now to the Obſervations. And firſt of all, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, all they are not Gods children, or the children of the promiſe, (to whom ſalvation belongeth,) that are of the race and linage according to the fleſh: hence the obſervation is this,</p>

The very coming and diſcending from holy parents by the courſe of nature, is not ſufficient to intitle a man, or a woman into the promiſes of God, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life and ſalvation; becauſe a man is the child of a holy parent, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parents, therefore to have right and title to the promiſes of God, no, no ſuch matter: Hence it was that the Lord Jeſus did ſo often check the Jewes, for ſtanding ſo much upon their birth and parentage, that they were the children of Abraham, as if that were ſufficient to eſtate them in the promiſe appertaining to Abraham, and was appropriated to Abraham and his ſeed; ſaith Chriſt, Matth. 3.9. <hi>think not to ſay within your ſelves, We have Abraham to our Father;</hi> do not think that this is ſufficient, to intitle you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to grace and ſalvation, you are his children but by nature; ſo in Joh. 8.

                  <p>Now then, the Lord in theſe words maketh known, that Iſaac was the choſen ſeed of Abraham, that did belong unto Gods election, that he had rejected Iſhmael from all eternity, though he was the ſon of Abraham, and appointed Iſaac to life and ſalvation: And ſo this example of Iſaac, and of Iſhmael, doth very well fit the purpoſe of the Apoſtle, namely this, to ſhew that though the Jews come of Abraham, according to the courſe of Nature, and are his ſeed by carnal generation, yet are not all ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto Gods eternal election, and though they be rejected, there is no breach of the promiſe of the Lord, of which the Apoſtle treateth in this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Now we are to obſerve in the firſt place, touching theſe words, they being conſidered, (as you heard) the words of God to Abraham, thus much; That God in theſe words maketh known unto Abraham, a great difference that was between his two ſons, Iſhmael and Iſaac; ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as Abraham did not think upon, nor could not take notice of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till God did make it known: Abraham without queſtion, did judge both of his ſons to be in the ſame eſtate; Iſhmael, and Iſaac, to be in the ſame condition, and that both had right and title to that Covenant, in Gen. 17.7. <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed.</hi> Thus Abraham thought, and therefore Abraham circumciſed both his children, yea Iſhmael in the firſt place, and inſtructed both, and brought them up both alike; yet you ſee God putteth a wide, and a large difference between them, his ſons, Iſhmael and Iſaac: Iſaac was the choſen ſeed; Iſhmael was not; Iſaac belonged

                  <p>Before the effectual calling of Gods choſen, they are in the ſame eſtate and condition, with thoſe that belong not unto Gods election, they are prone unto evil as well as others, they are as vile in the practiſe of ſinne, as any other, unleſſe God do reſtrain them. No man can ſay, this is one that belongeth to Gods election, and this is not, untill God do put a difference between them. And this truth hath not onely ground here, but alſo plentiful evidence in many places of Scripture, in 1 Cor. 6.9, 10.

                  <hi>but the children of the promiſe]</hi> For the underſtanding of this phraſe; and form of ſpeech, we muſt know, that Iſaac Abrahams ſon was a child of the promiſe, (what is that?) why ſurely, ſuch a child, as the promiſe gave birth unto, Abraham begot Iſaac, of his wife Sarah indeed according to the courſe of Nature, but not by the force, ſtrength, and vertue of nature, he was born merely by a ſpecial promiſe made unto Abraham, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and ſtrength of that ſpecial promiſe, cited by the Apoſtle, made in Gen. 18.9. <hi>Sarah thy wife ſhall have a ſon;</hi> and ſo though he was begotten by Abraham according to the courſe of Nature, but not by the force of Nature: For when this promiſe was made unto Abraham, <hi>Sarah thy wife ſhall have a ſon,</hi> Abraham and Sarah were old, and both ſtrucken in years, and not of ability by nature to have a child, ſo that in regard of the force of nature, it was as impoſſible for Abraham to beget, or Sarah to bear a Child, as for a ſtone to flye upward; ſo that he was begotten by vertue of the Promiſe, for ſhe was paſt childbearing, and Abraham very old, ſo that the force and ſtrength of Nature in Abraham, and Sarah was not the cauſe of Iſaac's birth, but by vertue of the promiſe; ſo that we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by children of the promiſe, ſuch as after the manner of Iſaac are children of the promiſe, Gal. 4.28. <hi>Now we brethren, as Iſaac was, are the children of the Promiſe;</hi> That is, all ſuch as by vertue of the promiſe of grace, of life and ſalvation, are adopted and made the children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, by the vertue and force of the promiſe; the Goſpel being a quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goſpel, it being publiſhed, and they believing in it, they come to be the children of the promiſe, and born anew, not by nature, but by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>The meaning of the Apoſtle is this,
<q>That is, or my meaning is, that not they that are deſcended from Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, onely by the courſe of Nature, and according to the fleſh, and by carnal generation; they are not ſuch children as God hath bound himſelf unto by promiſe, in a ſpecial manner, that is to do good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by a ſpecial promiſe, according to the ſpeech unto Abraham, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed:</hi> But all ſuch that belong unto Gods election in time to be called, to be the ſons and daughters of God, the promiſe being publiſhed unto them, and are wrought upon by vertue of the Spirit, and the Promiſe, They onely, and none but they, are accounted and reputed for the true ſeed and children of Abraham, to whom the promiſe of mercy, grace, righteouſneſſe, and ſalvation belongeth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Come we now to the Doctrines. And here obſerve, That the Apoſtle doth expound himſelf, touching that, which is put down in the verſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, and delivereth his mind more plainly, then in the ſeventh verſe: the concluſion is this;</p>

The Paſchal Lamb, is called the Lords Paſſeover, that ſhould be eaten in deſtroying the Egyptians; then in the 27 verſe, it is ſaid to be the ſacrifice of the Lords paſſeover, more plainly expounding it: ſo in 1 Cor. 10.4.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108302:35"/> Scripture, is by Scripture it ſelf; we commonly give thus much to a man, that he is the beſt expounder of himſelf: ſo then learn we to apply and compare Scripture with Scripture: and in that we do not apply Scripture with Scripture, it is the reaſon why we do let ſlip other places that may help us in the true Application of Scripture: it is a ſubtilty that Satan, or the Divel, (and our hearts are ready to joyn with him,) that he maketh men to hale and draw unto themſelves ſuch places of Scripture as they think do favour them in their ſin, by their abuſe of it, they lay hands upon thoſe places that ſo ſeem, &amp; willingly and purpoſely forgetting other places, that do draw them back from ſuch conjecturing; as the Uſurer, wil draw ſuch places as may countenance his ſin, (to his ſeeming) and neglect thoſe that draw him to the contrary: Yea many men they turn Gods grace unto wantonneſſe, to go on in ſin with an high hand, and ſtiffe neck, adding <hi>drunkenneſſe to thirſt;</hi> they are impenitent in their ſins, and will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and yet for all this they perſwade themſelves that they ſhall find mercy from the Lord: And why? whence cometh this?

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>TOuching the Apoſtles Denyal, that they that came of Abraham ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh are not the true ſeed, theſe words being an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the words foregoing, the point hence offered, is the ſame which hath been ſtood upon before, which I think needleſſe to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Doctrine being, That the coming or deſcending of good and godly parents is not ſufficient to intitle us to be heires of the promiſe, and Gods children. I ſay the point hence ariſing being the ſame, therefore I will not here meddle with it; But come to the Apoſtles affirmation, leaving his negation, That they onely are accounted the true ſeed of Abraham, who are the children of the promiſe, that is, (as we ſhewed you in opening the Text,) they only that are after the manner of Iſaac, children of the promiſe, belonging unto Gods election, by the ſpecial grace of God, and made Gods children, hy the vertue of Gods promiſe, they onely are reckoned and accounted for the true ſeed of Abraham, to whom grace and ſalvation belongeth.</p>
                  <p>Now from theſe words, thus underſtood, two things are offered unto our conſideration, (to be ſtood upon in particular,) the firſt is, the efficacy and force of the words of Gods promiſe, the force, and ſtrength, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of it, concerning mercy, grace, righteouſneſſe, life and ſalvation, to all that believe in Chriſt, and repent of their ſins. In a word, the efficacy and force of the Word of the Goſpel, which indeed is a word of promiſe, it propoundeth to all true believers that are repentant for their ſins, mercy, grace, righteouſneſſe, life and ſalvation: the obſervation is this,</p>
                  <p>That the Word of Gods ſaving promiſe, the Word of the Goſpel, is a moſt powerful, and a moſt effectual Word; it is of a begetting nature, it is able (as an Inſtrument) to beget children unto God, and it doth (in Gods appointed time) effectually work upon Gods choſen, and make them actually the Children of God, ſo that they may be truly called the children of the promiſe; as that ſpecial promiſe in Gen. 18. <hi>Sarah thy wife ſhall have a ſon,</hi> as that gave birth and being to Iſaac, (when there was no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood or poſſibility of his being and birth from his parents, Abraham and Sarah,) ſo the Word of Gods ſaving promiſe, the words of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, giveth a ſpiritual being and birth to Gods choſen, and make them actually the children of God, (in his appointed time) when there is no likelihood nor poſſibility in nature; Yea, when their Nature is in flat oppoſition, and contrariety unto it; then doth the Word of the Goſpel make them actually the children of God. And to this purpoſe ſpeaketh that holy and Evangelical Prophet, the Prophet Eſay, Eſay 11.6, 7, 8.9. the holy Prophet ſheweth, that in the dayes of Chriſt, ſuch ſhould be the force and powerful working of the Goſpel, that it ſhould make men of Wolves to become lambs, and of Leopards, as meek as kids, and men that were as Lions, (of a Lioniſh nature) to be as meek as a fat beaſt, and as gentle, that children ſhould lead them, ſuch as were of a wolviſh and lio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Nature; (for ſo we are by nature fierce, and cruel, and ſavage, to become meek and gentle,) and ſo he goeth on in ſetting forth the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful working of the Goſpel: ſo in Joh. 5.25. ſaith the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I ſay unto you, the hour cometh, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the Word of God, and they that hear it ſhall live:</hi> where by <hi>dead</hi> 'we ſhall underſtand, thoſe that are ſpiritually dead, and not corporally dead, for of thoſe he ſpeaketh in the 28 verſe; he ſaith, that the voyce of the Spirit of God ſhall come to thoſe that are in the graves, and they ſhall ariſe; but hereby thoſe that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108302:36"/> are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, Epheſ. 2.1. and ſuch as are ſpiritually dead, to put the life of grace, and of faith, and of holineſſe into their hearts and ſoules; in the 1. of James 18. ſaith the Apoſtle; (ſpeaking of God,) <hi>of his own will begat he us with the Word of truth;</hi> by an emphaſis, or excellency, a begetting word, the word of the Goſpel, and not to adde more places, this doth ſufficiently prove, that the Goſpel of God is an effectual Word, and doth work upon Gods choſen, in time, and make them to become Gods children actually; whereas before they were potentially, and may be called the children of the Promiſe: The Reaſons and grounds are theſe;</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, the Goſpel it is <hi>the arm of the Lord;</hi> ſo ſaith the Prophet, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The word of the Goſpel, it adminiſtreth to Gods choſen, Gods Spirit; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> whence it is that the Apoſtle in Gal. 3.2. demandeth of the Galathians, <hi>What?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Received ye the Spirit by the preaching of the Law, or rather by the preaching of the doctrine of Faith?</hi> the doctrine of the Goſpel, that is the means of conveying unto you the Spirit, namely, the Goſpel of God which conveyeth it. Now the Spirit of God ſtirreth up the unbelieving, (that are Gods choſen,) and inableth them to believe, yea it doth beget faith in their hearts, and doth certainly and infallibly (and that without reſiſtance) actually incline their hearts to believe in Chriſt, and ſo to become actually Gods children; thus doth the holy Spirit of God (given to Gods cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,) bend and bowe their hearts inabling them to believe, and make them certainly and infallibly Gods Children, ſuch is the power of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine (in the firſt place) doth point out unto us one main dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> that is between the Law and the Goſpel, the law doth onely diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſin unto man, and what the leaſt ſin of man deſerveth, and is able to go no further, it cannot deliver unto a man any means of comfort, but ſeaveth a man liable to the curſe of the Law, it ſheweth them not the means to eſcape the curſe, onely as a Schoolmaſter it ſendeth men to Chriſt, not by teaching and inſtructing, but by whipping and ſcourging, by terrifying upon the ſight of ſin, it ſheweth them no pity, nor no compaſſion, it dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them from it ſelf, to ſeek unto a better Schoolmaſter, and better Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, to go unto Chriſt, Gal. 3.14. <hi>the Law is our Schoolmaſter to drive us to Chriſt.</hi> But now the Goſpel is of force to work upon Gods choſen, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, it is able to confer, and to adminiſter unto Gods choſen, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, which Spirit doth beget faith in their hearts, and ſo they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come actually the Children of God; this is the efficacy and power of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Is this ſo, that the Word of Gods promiſe, (the Goſpel) is ſo powerful, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> and ſo effectual, and able (as an Inſtrument) to beget children to God? Oh then I beſeech you, in the fear of God, look unto it; learn we upon this ground, that the Word of the Goſpel (we living under the preaching of it,) be thus powerful in our hearts and ſoules in particular, let us never reſt, untill we find that the preaching of the Goſpel hath ſo wrought upon our hearts and ſoules, that it be ſo effectual in us to bear down the ſtrength of nature, and whatſoever ſtandeth in oppoſition againſt it, and to caſt down the ſtrongeſt hold of ſin and Satan in our hearts, and that it hath conferred, and conveyed the holy Spirit of God, and thereby wrought
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108302:37"/> faith in our hearts; Oh let us never reſt, untill we find this working. And conſider, the Goſpel, it is the arm of God, it hath made ſome men of wolves, to become as lambs; of Lions, fat beaſt; it hath beaten down the pride of their hearts, it hath hammered, their hard hearts, it hath quelled and overmaſtered their over-ruling and predominant cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: take onely the example of the Apoſtle Paul, that was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the voyce of Chriſt from heaven, (and the voyce of the Goſpel is as powerful,) from a bloody and tyrannical perſecutor, to a famous and renowned Preacher of the Goſpel, Gal. 1.22. And we read not onely in the primitive ſtories of the Church, but have found alſo in our own time, that the Goſpel of God hath been of ſuch force, that it hath made many to leave their Fathers, their Mothers, wives, children, friends, their lands and livings, and all their riches, and poſſeſſions, and to loſe their lives by fire, and ſword, and faggot, and by cruel tortures, yea by as cruel tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as their tormentors could lay upon them. And is not the voyce of the Goſpel now as powerful, is not the Goſpel able to make thee now to lay aſide thy profits, or pleaſures, as thy Carding, or Dicing? nay not to lay aſide a cup of beer or wine, not needful for thee, is not the Goſpel able to make thee to lay aſide a needleſſe new fangled attire on thy head? to make thee cut off thy long ſhag, and ruffian-like hair? to make thee leave off thy covetouſneſſe, thy Drunkenneſſe, thy whoring thy common ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by faith and troth? is it not able to do this? is the power of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel abated? can it not make thee leave off thy darling ſin? it was wont to do this in former time. And the Goſpel is as powerful now, and as able to throw down the ſtrongeſt hold of ſin and Satan as ever, 2 Cor. 10.4. to throw down imaginations and ſtrong holds of corruption, if thou live under the Goſpel, where the Goſpel is truly and faithfully preached, and aſſuredly either the Goſpel hath thus wrought in thee to the purging out of corruptions, and thoſe ſins thou once delightedſt in, or it ſealeth up unto thee a heavy and fearful concluſion; what is that, you will ſay? Take it from the Apoſtle, not from me, in 2 Cor. 4.3. mark what he ſaith, The Apoſtle in the ſecond verſe of the Chapter ſheweth, that he, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, handled the Word of God not deceitfully, but in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the truth, in plain evidence of the Spirit, and of power, they approved themſelves to every mans conſcience, then mark what he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in by way of inference, <hi>if the Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh;</hi> if the Goſpel that hath been ſo plentifully and powerfully preached, and ſo painfully delivered in the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit, work not in your hearts and ſouls, It is to be feared you are in the way to deſtruction, and in a fearful condition: Oh then let us look that we find the power of the Goſpel in our hearts and ſoules, and conſider, it will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all avail us to know, that the Goſpel is the power of God to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, though it were to thouſands, yea to all the world beſides, if we find it is not ſo to us, to commend the Goſpel, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and the comforts of it, and to ſay it is a bleſſed Sermon, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sermon, the beſt ſermon that ever I heard; it may be worthy to be commended, but hath it wrought upon thee? thou finding it not power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to thee, it will not be available to take notice of the Goſpel, to be a Word of power in the general, and in the abſtract, and not find it ſo in the particular to thy ſelf, is the caſe of the Devil; he knoweth the Goſpel is a comfortable Word; but ſee what good haſt thou gotten by knowing it, hath it beat down thy pride, thy covetouſneſſe, thy earthly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? happy art thou; otherwiſe, it will not be available: therefore in the fear of God, let us never reſt till we find that we living under the ſound preaching of the Goſpel, that hath been effectual to our ſoules and hearts, and hath beaten down our pride, our earthly mindedneſſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant

Then in the eighth verſe our Apoſtle putteth this down in the general, That they onely are the true children of Abraham, becauſe they are the children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. In this ninth Verſe he confirmeth it by a teſtimony of Scripture, that Iſaac was a child of the promiſe, taken out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.10. <hi>I will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come unto thee in the time appointed, and Sarah ſhall have a ſon;</hi> this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle affirmeth to be the Word of promiſe.</p>
               <p>So then in this ninth verſe, we have (for the general matter of it,) theſe two things to be conſidered:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The ſpeech of God to Abraham, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.10 and in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance here recorded by the Apoſtle, wherein God hath ſet down the time when Sarah ſhall have a ſon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Apoſtles note upon this ſpeech of God, what kind of ſpeech this was to Abraham, namely a promiſſory ſentence, <hi>This is a word of promiſe, in the ſame time will I come, and Sarah ſhall have a ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come we now to the opening of the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is a word of promiſe,]</hi> That is, this teſtimony of Scripture, (which now I alledge) which is the ſpeech of God to Abraham, it is a promiſſory ſentence, a word of promiſe, promiſing a ſpecial mercy, a ſpecial bleſſing, and a ſpecial good thing to Abraham.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the ſame time will I come,]</hi> Or, as it is in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> I will come accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the time of life, his meaning is, when this time of the year ſhall come and revive, and come again, even in plain terms, this time twelve moneths, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. where God ſaith, he will eſtabliſh his Covenant, and Sarah thy wife ſhall have a ſon, at this time the next year, the meaning is this time twelve moneths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sarah thy wife ſhall have a ſon.]</hi> That is, ſhe ſhall conceive and bear a ſon, of her own body and bowels, and none other womans child ſhall be for her: ſo the meaning in general is this,
<q>This ſentence that I alledge which is the ſpeech of God to Abraham, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.10. it is a promiſſory ſentence, promiſing a ſpecial bleſſing unto Abraham, wherein God ſaith, when this time of the year ſhall revive, even this time twelve moneths ſhall thy wiſe <hi>Sarah</hi> have a child begotten and born of her own body.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Come we to the obſervations.</p>
               <p>And in that the Apoſtle here alledging a ſentence and place of Scripture, doth not barely deliver the words of Scripture, but he putteth it out with this note, <hi>this is a word of promiſe.</hi> In that he telleth us plainly, that the ſpeech which God uſed to Abraham, (and here cited by himſelf,) is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory ſentence, which any man that looketh upon the text, and is able to judge of it aright, ſhall ſee it to be ſo, when God ſaith, <hi>at ſuch a time will I come, and Sarah thy wife ſhall have a ſon.</hi> And yet the Apoſtle pointeth it out, <hi>this is a word of promiſe.</hi> Hence we learn,</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:108302:38"/>
               <p>That it is juſtifiable, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                  </label> and a warrantable courſe in preaching the Word of God; for the Preacher to ſay unto his hearers, this is a point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, yea when he comes to make uſe and application unto the people, to ſay, this is a word of comfort, this is a word of terrour, this of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, this of Exhortation, (and the like) we find it an uſual thing with the holy Prophets of God in the time of the Old Teſtament, when they did threaten Judgments, they did ſet this before, <hi>the burthen of the Lord:</hi> as the burthen of the Lord againſt Edom, the burthen of the Lord againſt Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and the like, as we may ſee in the Prophet Eſay, Jeremiah, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel, and other Prophets.</p>
               <p>But indeed it is thought by ſome, that are utter enemies to the plain teaching of the Word, that this is needleſſe: And they do find fault with this manner of teaching, and deride it, and ſay, it is a baſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible manner of preaching; why (ſay they) this is all one as if a man ſhould draw the picture of a man and paint it out in colours, and then to write in Capital letters by him, this is his head, this his armes, this his noſe, and the like; were not this ridiculous, ſay they?</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee theſe ſons of Belial, theſe men, they deride that which is warranted by the holy Prophets, and holy Apoſtles, and that which doth moſt good in all experience, 2 Tim. 3.16. The Scripture is given by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and is profitable to teach, to correct, to improve; now may not the Scriptures be applyed to this end and purpoſe? and being ſo applyed, may not the people be told that this is matter of Doctrine, and that this is a word of comfort? or a word of Inſtruction, or a word of Confutation, confuting the Papiſts, or other enemies? doubtleſſe they may, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe indeed by this means the people ſhall be the better able to go along with the Preacher, and more diſtinctly to take notice of the things delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what ſerveth for information of Judgement, in matters of faith? what for reformation, of their hearts and lives in doing of good, and avoiding of evil, and the building of them up in the wayes of holineſſe, therefore let others mock and ſcoffe what they will, yet Miniſters of God, that make conſcience of their duty, have no cauſe to be aſhamed of it, it is the moſt powerful and profitableſt kind of preaching, and doth build up the people in faith, and encourage them in every good duty.</p>
               <p>Again, the Apoſtle having ſaid, <hi>This is a word of promiſe,</hi> he then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth the promiſe of a temporal bleſſing, that Sarah ſhould have a ſon.</p>
               <p>Hence we ſee, that the Promiſes of God in Scripture are of two ſorts, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
                  </label> either principal promiſes, or of a lower degree; principal Promiſes touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, mercy, grace, life and ſalvation; and of a lower degree, as to have food, and apparel, and outward good things, and children: Now the promiſes of God that are of a lower degree, they do depend upon thoſe principal promiſes, and we cannot apprehend the Promiſes of God with true comfort, for our good, unleſſe we firſt lay hold on the promiſes of God in Chriſt; Abraham did firſt believe the promiſes of mercy, of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and ſalvation, for his juſtification, and then he believed the promiſe that he ſhould have a ſon in his old age, as appeareth, Rom. 4.9, 19, 20. And that holy Father, Noah, firſt he was by faith made the heir of righteouſneſſe, and then did he believe the Promiſes of God for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in the Ark, Heb. 11.7.</p>
               <p>Therefore deceive not thy ſelf in any particular; <label type="milestone">

                  </label> we cannot truſt God with any true comfort for any temporal good thing, unleſſe we be able to reſt upon his promiſe and mercy in Chriſt, for ſalvation; unleſſe we reſt upon the main promiſe of Chriſt, we cannot reſt upon him for outward good things, with any comfort, for the promiſes of God, whether of this life, or the life to come, they are <hi>yea and amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. in Chriſt they are ratified and confirmed.</p>

But now the point is, That God doth perform his promiſe in his appointed time, he keepeth his time ſtrictly, in the very nick and point of time will he accompliſh it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13, 14. God told Abraham, that his ſeed ſhould be a ſtranger in a land not theirs, and ſhould be in bondage and thraldome for a long time, but when that time ſhall come to an end, I will judge that nation, and they ſhall come out with great riches; how was this fulfilled? read Exodus 12.41. when that the very time was expired, in the ſame day, in the very ſelf-ſame day all the power of Pharaoh and Egypt could not hold them, but they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and Pharaoh and his hoſt deſtroyed: So the Lord threatened that Iſrael ſhould be in Babylon 70 yeares, as we read Jer. 25.11, 12. they ſhould be in thaldome there ſo long. But when the time was come, and the very day, Daniel underſtanding it by books, he goeth unto God by prayer, Dan. 9.23. and in the very beginning of his humiliation, and ſupplication unto God, did the decree come forth in the peoples delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the very day that the time was expired; and in Habbac. 2.3. ſaith the Prophet, <hi>The Viſion is for an appointed time, the time ſhall come, and not lye, though it tarry long:</hi> and (not to heap up many places) indeed all the Promiſes of God are of an appointed time, and when that time is come, God doth fulfil and make them good to his children; what is the ground of this?</p>

No, no, the Lord hath ſet his time; yea conſider alſo, that not onely dayes, and minutes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, are not onely known to the Lord, but are moſt ſtrictly and preciſely known, and kept of the Lord; and as we cannot come in particular to any comfort for our bodies, or ſoules, till the time come, ſo when the time is come, we may aſſure our ſelves, God will not paſſe one minute of an hour, he will not break with thee, but will give it thee in his time; therefore wait untill that time come, Heſter 4.16. when Heſter denyed to go unto the

I might here ſtand to ſhew, That nothing is hard and impoſſible to God, he is the God of Nature, he is not tyed to nature, or the order of nature, he can give children, and power to one to bring forth children, that have no natural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at all; God can bring things to paſſe, when there is no probability in nature. But to paſſe by this, as not intended by the Apoſtle here in this place.</p>
               <p>Come we now then to the tenth Verſe, and ſo to the verſes following, to the 14 verſe, for they all make but one context, <hi>neither onely this, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekah when ſhe had conceived by one, even our father Iſaac,</hi> &amp;c. In theſe words our Apoſtle falleth upon a new inſtance, and example, and he giveth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other inſtance, and example, to prove, That all they were not true Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, the true ſeed of Abraham, to whom grace, life and ſalvation belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that came of Abraham by the courſe of nature; but onely the elect ſeed of Abraham, the choſen of God, that came of Abraham, they onely were the perſons to whom the promiſe did belong. And the inſtance that he bringeth, it is of the children of Iſaac, and Rebekah, which were Jacob and Eſau; and he ſheweth, that onely one of theſe, namely Jacob, was the true choſen ſeed of Iſaac, and the child to whom the promiſe of mercy and grace, life and ſalvation belongeth, and that Eſau was not: Though Eſau came both of Iſaac and Rebekah, as well as Jacob, by natural gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet Jacob was the choſen ſeed, and Eſau was not.</p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle addeth this example to the former, for this Reaſon, as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108302:40"/> more ſtrongly proving that which he had in hand; For ſome exceptions, might be taken by the Jews, againſt the former example, and inſtance of Iſaac and Iſhmael.</p>

                  </label> As they might ſay, What do you tell us of Iſaac and of Iſhmael, they were born of two Mothers, one of Sarah, and the other, of Hagar, and thoſe two Mothers, of far different conditions, the one a free-woman, and the other a bond-ſervant, Iſhmael was the ſon of a bond woman, and therefore rejected, but Iſaac the ſon of a free woman, and therefore recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle preventeth this exception of theirs, in putting down this example of Jacob and Eſau, which were both of them of the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, begotten by one; namely Iſaac, conceived of one, namely Rebekah, is born both at a birth, they were twins, and of the two, Eſau the elder; for he came out before his brother, and yet Jacob the younger is the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſeed of God, and elect veſſel of God, and Eſau is not; even theſe two born of the ſame Father and Mother, and both at one time, and of the two Eſau the elder, yet Jacob was the true and choſen ſeed, and Eſau is not; therefore this maketh ſtrongly for the purpoſe of the Apoſtle, to prove, that the promiſe of God, of mercy, life, grace and ſalvation, belongeth not to thoſe that are born of the ſame parents.</p>
               <p>Now the general matter of theſe four Verſes, (to take them all in one context) may be thus Illuſtrated and laid forth unto us; In the tenth verſe the Apoſtle falleth upon this example, this inſtance of Jacob and Eſau, and he ſheweth it appeareth plainly, not onely in the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Iſaac and Iſhmael, but in theſe Children of Iſaac and Rebekah, namely Jacob and Eſau, that were begotten of one and the ſame Father Iſaac, and born of one and the ſame mother, Rebekah, at one and the ſame time; yet the one is rejected, and the other received: ſo that this is a ſtrong concluſion, that grace, life and ſalvation, belongeth not to all that came of Abraham. Then unto this our Apoſtle yeeldeth a proof; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it, and that from the voyce of God himſelf, which is moſt ſure and certain, amplified by the circumſtance of the time, namely that before theſe two children were born, when they were in the womb, and had neither done good nor evil, it was ſaid, that the elder ſhould ſerve the younger, even then, when they were in her womb, ſhe going to ask counſel of the Oracle of God, why the children ſtrove in the womb? Anſwer was made, the elder ſhould ſerve the younger; and then he ſetteth forth the end and cauſe of this, why the elder ſhould ſerve the younger, namely, that all things might depend upon the election and purpoſe of the Lord, and that not by works, but of him that freely called; for before the children were born, when they had neither done good nor evil, that the purpoſe of God might be fulfilled, not of works, ſtill he preventeth that, it was ſaid, the elder ſhould ſerve the younger; then this is further proved unto us by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of the Prophet Malachy, Mal. 1.2, 3. as it is written, <hi>I have loved Iacob, and hated Eſau;</hi> by which teſtimony of Malachy, the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the 25. of Geneſis, and ſheweth the reaſon of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two brothers; why God was pleaſed to put ſuch a ſpacious and wide difference between them; ſurely the reaſon of it was, becauſe God loved the one, and hated the other, loved Jacob, and hated Eſau: why ſhould Jacob have the preeminence above his brother, being younger? God anſwereth, <hi>I have loved Iacob, and hated Eſau;</hi> Jacobs dominion over Eſau was from Gods love, Eſau's ſubjection unto Jacob, was from Gods hatred; this is the teſtimony, and oracle of God himſelf: this is the cauſe of Jacobs domination, and Eſau's ſubjection.

<q>Even Rebekah, when ſhe had conceived by one, even our father Iſaac, from whom we came that are Jewes, one of her children was received, and the other rejected.</q>

               <p>Come we now to the Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>Obſerve we, the Apoſtle here bringeth an inſtance and example, ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and more free from exception, then the example of Iſaac and Iſhmael, out of which they could not winde themſelves though, if they would cavil, never ſo much, namely of Jacob and Eſau, whereby he proveth, That Gods Promiſe, that he made to Abraham, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed,</hi> did not belong to all that came of Abraham by the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which indeed the Jews held very ſtifly, and were very reſolute in this opinion, out of their miſconceit, and they thought it ſtrange, yea to this day they think it ſtrange, that they that came of Abraham by the courſe of nature, and were of his loynes, and of his ſeed, ſhould not have part in the Promiſe made to Abraham; what? they rejected that came of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, by the courſe of nature, as the Apoſtle did ſeem to intimate, and they thought they had ground for themſelves, and their conceit, from the promiſe of God, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed.</hi> Now the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle laboureth to beat them off from this miſconceit, and falſe opinion of theirs, and to that end he laboureth earneſtly, and bringeth inſtance upon inſtance, example upon example, of Iſaac and Iſhmael, and then a ſtronger of Jacob and Eſau: the concluſion following is this,</p>

And hence it is, (to clear the point,) that deceivers, teachers of errours, falſe teachers, do commonly buzz into the eares of ſilly and ſimple ones, that they have ground of Scripture for that which they are about to deliver, and to broach unto them; this is the firſt ground they lay, they have Scripture for it, and by that means many times, they do winde into the ſoules of the ſimple, and get within them, and ſo faſten their errours, and falſe concluſions, and opinions upon their ſoules, and in time make the ſilly and ſimple people, ſo ſettled, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their falſe concluſions, that they will not be removed nor drawn away from them, this is the common doings of falſe teachers, to ſcrew and wind themſelves into their ſoules, under colour of Scripture. To this purpoſe ſpeaketh the Apoſtle, Act. 20.30. <hi>From your ſelves ſhall ariſe ſome that ſhall ſpeak perverſe things, to draw diſciples after them;</hi> the words are very weighty, and ſignificant, and there is an emphaſis in this, that falſe teachers riſing up in the Church of Epheſus, ſhould ſpeak perverſe things under the colour of Scripture, pervert the Scriptures, and in time they ſhall ſo far prevail with ſome, as they ſhall draw them after them as their diſciples, as a Dog followeth his Maſter in a ſtring, and ſhall be tyed unto them with a cord, and ſo ſwear unto their opinions, <hi>(Jurare in verba Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtri,)</hi> ſwearing to the words of their Maſters, and in time become wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108302:41"/> obſtinate in holding of them, in the 2 Corinth. 11. the Apoſtle put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out the dealing of falſe teachers notably, and he blameth the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, in the 20 verſe, ſaith he, <hi>you are ſo fooliſh, that you ſuffer your ſelves, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you;</hi> where he maketh it clear and manifeſt, that where falſe teachers, and Corner-creepers are ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they bring men into bondage, and do make them in a miſerable ſlavery, and devour them, yea they carry the ſimple and ſilly ſoules, even as a Bear, a Wolf, or a Lyon, carrieth away the ſilly Lamb, that cannot reſiſt, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: ſo they carry away the ſimple ones under a colour ſtill, pretending truth and Scripture, ſo that the ſimple cannot reſiſt, and in time they make them obſtinate and wilful: thus it was with the Arians and Donatiſts, and thus it is in our times, as may be proved at large.</p>

But the Holy Ghoſt ſaith of Eſau, and ſetteth this black mark upon him, to be a prophane perſon, a vile man, one that ſold his birth-right for a portion of meat, Heb. 12.16. yea the context ſaith,<note place="margin">Gen. 25.34.</note> that Eſau contemned his birth-right, which was a great honour and dignity, he contemned it in reſpect of a portion of meat to ſatisfie his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for the preſent: thus you ſee a large, wide difference between theſe two men, the one holy, the other irreligious, ſo that children of the ſame parents, and born at the ſame time, may differ one from another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding much: and the obſervation ariſing hence is this,</p>

And (to adde ſome further ground, for the proof of this point,) we find, that the Lord did forbid his people continually, and from time to time, to obſerve times, and to mark the conſtellations of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, as if ſo be that either the manners or diſpoſitions of men, and the affaires of men, and the ſucceſſe of things were over-ruled, and overſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, Deut. 18.10. <hi>Let there be none found amongſt you, that regard times after the manner of the heathen;</hi> who did think that the times had an over-ruling and an overſwaying in them of the manners, and lives of men, and the ſucceſſe of their buſineſſe: Oh ſaith God, take heed, let there be none ſuch; and in Jer. 10.2. the Lord ſaith expreſly, <hi>you ſhall not learn the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

Now the Lord forbidding this marking of the conſtellations of the heavens, as if the ſucceſſe of men depended upon the poſition of the ſtars and planets, it is a plain evidence, and confirmeth unto us, that the coming of the ſame blood, and of the ſame parents, and being born at the ſame time, under the ſame conſtellation of the heavens, and ſtars, is not a thing that maketh children of the ſame mind, and like carriage, and behaviour.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe two Verſes our Apoſtle bringeth proof to that point and poſition, put down in the verſes foregoing, and the thing delivered was, that it appeared plainly in the two children of Iſaac and Rebekah, That the Promiſe of God touching mercy, grace, righteouſneſs, life and ſalvation, did not belong to all that came of Abraham and Iſaac, by the courſe of Nature: this was the Concluſion which the Apoſtle proveth in theſe two verſes, and he proveth it from the voyce of God himſelf; In that God ſaith to Rebekah, that the Elder of her children ſhould ſerve the Younger, Gen. 25.23. ſhe coming to conſult with the Oracle, It was told her, that two Nations ſtrove in her womb, and the elder ſhould ſerve the younger. And this the Apoſtle amplifieth, by the circumſtance of the time, before the children were born, when they had neither done good nor evil. And this is further enlarged by the end of it; to what end? namely, that the purpoſe of God might remain and abide firm and ſtable, and unmoveable, according to election, and that not by works, but by him that called. Now this being the general drift of theſe two Verſes, Come we to the ſenſe and meaning of them, which are full of difficulty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(For before the children were born,]</hi> It is moſt plain (by the context) that the Apoſtle meaneth Jacob and Eſau, for they are ſpecified in the context, <hi>were born,</hi> that is, while theſe two children were in the womb of Rebekah their Mother, and not yet brought forth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>and had done neither good nor evil,]</hi> That is, actually ſinned; for here Original corruption is not ſpecified, for originally they were guilty before the Lord, and in their typical conſideration, Original corruption is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, they being conſidered as types of the Elect, and of the Reprobate, and in that conſideration they are laid before us, as having done neither good, nor evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the purpoſe of God might remain according to election,]</hi> Or rather thus, <hi>That the purpoſe of God according to election might remain.</hi> So that by <hi>the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God</hi> in this place, we are to underſtand Gods eternal decree, that which he purpoſed from everlaſting within his own bleſſed Majeſtie, out of the good pleaſure of his Will, or according to the counſel of his Will, Epheſ. 1.11. that which God in himſelf from everlaſting purpoſed, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>according to election,]</hi> Or, concerning election, that is, touching his free choice of ſome to grace and glory, and his rejecting of others; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der election, is included the contrary, namely reprobation, that purpoſe which was touching free grace and glory, according to election, according to the act of election, and reprobation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>that it might remain]</hi> Or rather might be firm and ſtable, and might abide unſhaken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>not by works, but by him that calleth.]</hi> That is, ſay the Arminians and the Anabaptiſts, (if you will believe them,) not by the works of the Law, but by faith obeying him that calleth; not by ſeeking righteouſneſſe and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the works of the Law, but by faith obeying him that calleth. And upon this they would ground their groſſe errour, and falſe concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Eſau was a type of thoſe that are rejected of God, becauſe they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108302:44"/> ſeek righteouſneſſe and ſalvation by the works of the Law, and Jacob was a type of ſuch that are then choſen of God, when God doth ſee faith in them with perſeverance, and are then choſen of God actually, God purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to chooſe them upon foreſeen faith, and doth actually chooſe them, upon the faith that he ſeeth in them with perſeverance; But this is a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction; for conſider, how could Eſau be a type of ſuch as are reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God? Eſau conſidered without works either good or evil, as he was being in the womb, how could he be a type of ſuch, that ſeek righteouſneſs by the works of the Law? Again, how could Jacob being conſidered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, as he was when he was choſen, before he was born, how could he be a type of thoſe that are then choſen of God, when God ſeeth faith in them with perſeverance? Can theſe things poſſibly agree and jump to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that are contraries, unleſſe they will have, that there is no analogy, no reſemblance, or proportion between types, and the things typified? how could Jacob be a type of thoſe that are choſen upon their faith with perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, he then having no faith? or how could Eſau be a type of thoſe that ſeek ſalvation by the works of the Law, he having no works, neither done good nor evil? this cannot be, there muſt be an analogy between types, and the thing typified. But the meaning of the word is, <hi>not by works,</hi> that is, not any thing depending upon the works of theſe two brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>but upon him that calleth.]</hi> That is, upon the free grace of God, calling his elect in time effectually.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was ſaid unto her,]</hi> That is, it was ſaid unto her by God himſelf, Gen. 25.23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The elder ſhall ſerve the younger.]</hi> That is, the Elder ſhall be under the Younger, ſhall be in ſubjection to the younger, and the younger ſhall rule over the elder. Now this being the meaning of the words, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that this is to be underſtood of Eſau and Jacob; firſt perſonally, that this oracle of God ſhould be fulfilled in Jacob and Eſau's perſons, that Eſau ſhould be ſubject to the perſon of Jacob. And alſo it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Hiſtorically, in their poſterity, the Edomites and Iſraelites, which were indeed the children and off-ſpring of Jacob and Eſau; ſo that it is to be underſtood both perſonally and hiſtorically.</p>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108302:44"/> the time of David, ſo that this is to be underſtood firſt perſonally, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward hiſtorically, in their poſterity 750 years after: Then thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive we the meaning of the Apoſtle in theſe two verſes,
<q>When theſe two children which Rebekah conceived were in her womb, and had done neither good nor evil, that the purpoſe of God which he had decreed from everlaſting, touching the free choyce of ſome, and the rejection of others, might be firm and ſtable, not depending upon any works of theſe two brethren, Jacob and Eſau, but his own free grace, calling his elect effectually, even then was it ſaid to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekah, by the Oracle, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger, and the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger rule over the elder; and that was fulfilled in their perſons, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in their poſterity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But yet further for the clearing of theſe words, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> a doubt remaineth to be removed; ſome may ſay, that the words of God here, <hi>(the elder ſhall ſerve the younger,)</hi> do not prove this concluſion, that the one ſhould be received to ſalvation, and the other rejected to damnation; for why? a man may be in poverty, may be poor, in bondage, and in miſerable ſlavery, ſo as that the Turks and others may be lords over them; doth it thereupon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the one of them is elected, and the other a reprobate? therefore (it ſeemeth) this was meant only of a temporal and outward ſervitude, and not of eternal election, and, ſay the Anabaptiſts, the Apoſtle here doth not write of eternal election and reprobation, he treateth of an outward ſervitude, that is, one may ſerve another, and be in bondage to another, doth it follow, the one is choſen, and the other rejected?</p>
               <p>Thoſe words of God, the Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> have not only reſpect to temporal ſervitude and dominion, the one ſhall be a lord, and the other an underling, in reſpect of outward eſtate, but they had alſo a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual meaning, and a ſpiritual ſenſe, and had reſpect to ſpiritual things of a heavenly life, eternal life, and eternal damnation; how prove you that? Thus, Jacob in his own perſon in outward things, was never as a lord over Eſau, but Eſau was rather a lord over him, and Jacob his ſervant; yea Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob doth often acknowledg, in Gen. 32.18, 20. Gen. 33.8, 13, 14, 15. My lord Eſau, it is a Preſent ſent to my lord Eſau by thy ſervant Jacob, ſo that Jacob in his own perſon, was rather a ſervant, then a lord, yet doubtleſſe, this did concern Jacobs perſon, as appeareth by the words of Iſaac, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger, and the Oracle of God was fulfilled in Jacobs perſon, yet you ſay Jacob was rather in ſubjection to Eſau; 'tis true, yet it was fulfilled in a ſpiritual manner, in that the birth-right was beſtowed upon Jacob, therein was Eſau made a ſlave unto Jacob, in the time of this life, for Jacob was a holy and good man, and the birthright conferred upon him, and in that reſpect Eſau was an underling, and a ſlave, though he was a lord, for Eſau being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the birth-right, was cut off from the covenant of grace, the birth-right being a type of adoption, and he being deprived of that, was cut off from the hope of grace, from life everlaſting, from the heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which was properly and truly annexed to thoſe that had the birth-right; now he having loſt this, and being derived to Jacob, he became a ſlave in his very perſon, though he was a lord, and had many Dukes came of him, yet Eſau a ſlave, a ſervant in compariſon of Jacob, and therefore theſe words of God, they had not only reſpect to temporal Dominions, and outward ſervitude, the one a lord, and the other a ſervant, which was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in their poſterity, but they had a ſpiritual meaning, and had reſpect to heavenly things, that concern eternal life, and eternal damnation, and do fitly prove the matter of Gods election, and reprobation, <hi>the elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come we now to matter of obſervation. And from the general view of this text, in that the Apoſtle here treateth of eternal election and reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108302:45"/> in particular perſons, in Jacob as the Elect, and Eſau as the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: hence we are given to underſtand thus much,</p>

And upon this ground learn to renounce this alſo as erroneous, that Chriſt dyed for all univerſally ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, as ſome Divines teach univerſal redemption; for Gods eternal election being not univerſal, Chriſts redemption is not univerſal, for Chriſt dyed only for the choſen of God, only for the elect, and he is the Saviour of his body, Epheſ. 5.23. This is a common thing when men are convinced of their ſins, to ſay, we are ſinners, but Chriſt dyed for all; this is a ſtaffe of reſt to reſt upon, and will fail in time of tryal, thou muſt have a better ground, if thou wilt look for ſalvation; how is that? Thus, thou muſt not only find thy ſelf freed by Chriſt from deſerved condemnation, but alſo from thy vain converſation; for certainly, whomſoever Chriſt is a Saviour to, by the merit of death to them, he is alſo a Saviour by the power of his death, and by the works of his Spirit, turning them from ſin to God, Titus 2.14.

                     </label> and his refuſing and rejecting of others; it is moſt free, moſt abſolute, it dependeth not upon any thing in man, or done by man, but onely upon the good pleaſure of God, it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth upon nothing out of God himſelf, but upon God merely and onely, the Lord from everlaſting appointing ſome to life and ſalvation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing others, did it out of the good pleaſure of his will, merely without reſpect had to any thing in men themſelves, any quality good or bad, or any thing done by them good or bad, as a cauſe moving him hereunto: Indeed (to prevent an Objection in the beginning,) I deny not, but I may ſafely ſpeak it, and hold it, that there was reaſon, and cauſe in the general, why God would appoint ſome to life and ſalvation, and why he would refuſe and reject others? why God would have ſome to be ſaved, and others to be caſt off and refuſed, never to attain ſalvation. I grant that; why? Becauſe both the mercy of God in pardoning ſin, and the Juſtice of God in puniſhing ſin, might appear and be glorified; God is a juſt God, and a merciful God, that theſe two might be manifeſted and declared, for if all had been ſaved, there is no place for his Juſtice, but that his mercy, and juſtice might appear, the one is ſaved, and the other rejected; this is the reaſon in the general: but why this or that particular man or woman was appointed to life and ſalvation, and not the other man or woman? why Peter, and not Judas? the onely reaſon of this, is the good will and pleaſure of God: Gods fore-appointing of ſome amongſt men, to life and and ſalvation, it did wholly and onely depend upon the good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, it had reſpect to nothing in man; no difference between man and man, ariſing from men themſelves, that the one was of a better nature and temper, or thus and thus qualified, or any thing done by them good or evil, but onely in God himſelf, Epheſ. 1.4. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God hath choſen us in Chriſt, before the foundations of the world was;</hi> what? for any goodneſſe or holineſſe that was in us, or he foreſaw would be in us? no, but <hi>that we ſhould be holy, and without blame.</hi> He hath choſen us not for foreſeen holineſſe, but that we ſhould be holy; this is the language of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan: then he ſubjoyneth in the fifth verſe, <hi>who hath predeſtinated us to be adopted through Ieſus Chriſt himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will;</hi> without reſpect had to any thing in us, or any thing done by us: ſo alſo in 2 Tim. 1.9. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of God, ſaith thus, <hi>he hath ſaved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works,</hi> (ſtill he renounces that) <hi>but according to his own promiſe and grace, which was ſhewed unto us through Ieſus Chriſt</hi> (when?) <hi>before the world was;</hi> before Jeſus Chriſt was incarnate, yea before there was a world, and before we had a being. And in Jude 4. verſe we read, that the Apoſtle ſpeaking of ſome which were ordained of old; when was that? ſurely from everlaſting, before
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108302:46"/> the world was, or they had a being; they were ordained of God to this condemnation; theſe places doth ſufficiently evidence unto us the truth of the point, that God from everlaſting foreappointed ſome particulars amongſt men to life and ſalvation, and refuſed and rejected others, out of the mere good pleaſure of his will, without any thing in man, either good or bad quality, or any thing done by man, either good or evil: No doubt God did foreſee theſe things in man, but not as a cauſe moving him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, but his election is free. And indeed it is an act of Gods ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that he hath over the creatures, which is altogether independent, upon any thing in the creature, or done by the creature, as the cauſe of it: as for example, In the firſt Creation of all things, when God created the world, he firſt made the matter of all things a confuſed Chaos, and out of that he made the diſtinction of ſeveral things, and creatures in their ſeveral kinds. Now as in that firſt Creation, when that the whole matter of it was alike, a confuſed heap, then there was reaſon, why one part of that matter ſhould become fire, another water, another the ayr, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther earth; Becauſe this was neceſſary, both for the beauty of the world, and the uſe of the creatures, that they might be uſeful both to man and beaſt, but why this or that part of the firſt matter ſhould be fire, and not water, why God would make that part water, and another part earth, a baſer element, no reaſon can be imagined of this, but onely the will of the Soveraign Creator, becauſe it pleaſed God to make one part of that firſt matter, water, and another fire, and another earth, and another ayr, he might have made that part fire, which was water, but it pleaſed the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Creator to make them ſo; So in the general, there was Reaſon why the Lord would receive ſome to ſalvation, and reject others to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, both for the manifeſtation of the glory of his mercy, and juſtice, but why God would appoint this or that particular man or woman to life and ſalvation, and not another man? why Peter, and not Judas? not any reaſon can be imagined, rightly and truly, but the good will and pleaſure of God.</p>

                  <p>And likewiſe this truth now delivered, meeteth with the erroneous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Arminians and Anabaptiſts, for they are near one to the other. The Arminians hold and affirm, that God did decree the choyce of ſome to life and ſalvation, not actually chuſe them, but decree ſome to life and ſalvation, upon the foreſight of their faith, with perſeverance; and ſo ſay the Anabaptiſts, it was upon the foreſight of their faith, and obedience to the Goſpel, ſo that they jump together in the matter, the one upon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen faith, and the other upon foreſight of obedience to the Goſpel; the Lord did foreſee that ſome would imbrace the Goſpel, ſome would believe in Chriſt, ſome would ſeek ſalvation by faith in Chriſt, upon the promiſes of God, and thereupon did he decree the choyce of ſome to life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or at leaſt ſay they, (mincing the matter) it was the rule which God did follow, in his choyce; we will not (ſay they) ſtand upon it, to be the cauſe, but it was the rule: A frivolous diſtinction, to diſtinguiſh between cauſe, and rule, or cauſe, and reaſon: But for the opinion, it is moſt falſe; for if ſo be the foreſight of faith, and of the obedience to the Goſpel, was the cauſe working God to decree the choyce of ſome to life
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108302:46"/> and ſalvation, then this will ſurely follow, that that which hath onely a being in time, was the cauſe of that which was altogether before time, then faith which hath no being in nature, but in time, it ſhall be the cauſe working God to decree the choyce of ſome to life and ſalvation before all times; a moſt groſſe and abſurd thing, that the thing (in time) ſhould over-rule the decree of God from everlaſting. Again, if ſo be Gods fore-appointing of ſome to life and ſalvation, had faith foreſeen for the cauſe of it; what need then had the Apoſtle, to bring that queſtion, or make that Objection that he doth in the 14 verſe of this Chapter, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? is there unrighteouſneſſe with God?</hi> there would be no ſhew, nor ſemblance of any injuſtice, or unrighteouſneſſe with God, if ſo be this were true, that Gods fore-appointing of ſome to life and ſalvation, had faith foreſeen, for the cauſe, if any had moved this queſtion, that it ſeemeth hard that before the children were born, God ſhould receive one, and reject the other, and ſo ſhould conclude, then God is unjuſt, and unrighteous. Then we might anſwer, ſpeaking in the language of the Arminians, God did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, long before, that Jacob would believe, and Eſau would not; and this would clear God from any ſuſpition of injuſtice, and this cavil would be quite taken away; and ſo we ſhould make the Apoſtle to ſpeak very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly, to move a queſtion that needed not, and make an objection need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, which were moſt wicked and blaſphemous once to ſuppoſe ſuch a thing of the bleſſed Apoſtle, which was guided by the holy Spirit of God infallibly, who had cauſe to move this queſtion: ſo then let the Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians and Anabaptiſts paſſe away with their idle fictions of their idle brains, contrary to the truth of God.</p>
                  <p>Is this ſo, that God hath fore-appointed ſome to life and ſalvation, <label type="milestone">

And take heed, that in regard of thy unworthineſſe, thou do not conclude, God will caſt thee off; no, God doth it not for any thing foreſeen, or done by thee, but onely of his free grace and mercy, and he will freely ſave thee. Again, upon this ground of truth learn we to acknowledge, and to magnifie the wonderful and unſpeakable goodneſſe of God; if we be ſuch as ſhall find our ſelves in the number of Gods choſen, we muſt learn to extol and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the mercy of God; for why? the Lord out of his mere good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, without reſpect had to any thing in us, or done by us, merely out of his free love, hath fore-appointed us to life and ſalvation, for which we cannot ſufficiently magnifie the goodneſſe of God, conſider it, there was no difference between thee and others, as thou diddeſt lye in the ſight of God; no difference between thee, and ſuch a one as is rejected and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and if ſo be God had not ſevered thee by his eternal election from

In the 2 Sam. 6.21. we read that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid danced and leaped, and rejoyced in his ſpirit exceedingly before the Ark of God: what was in Davids mind? was he a mad-man, as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael his wife told him? no, he conſidered that God had choſen him, and rejected the houſe of Saul; ſo he ſaith to Michael, the Lord hath choſen me, and my fathers houſe, and rejected thee, and thy fathers houſe; Oh then how ſhould we rejoyce in Spirit, and bleſſe and magnifie his mercy, that he hath choſen us not to a Temporal Kingdom, but to an eternal Kingdom in heaven: this ſhould make us rejoyce, from which he hath rejected many thouſands as good as thy ſelf: how can I be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently thankful unto God? if ſo be men of eminency and place ſhould ſhew us a common kindneſſe and courteſie, we little regard it; but if ſo be thoſe eminent perſons do admit us unto their ſpecial favour, and do yeeld unto us ſuch a kindneſſe, as they will not communicate to any but their deareſt favourites and friends; then we highly eſteem of it: Oh then conſider, the Lord hath done us that favour, wherein the greateſt part of the world, and of mankind, have no ſhare, no part nor portion; how ſhould this teach us to magnifie, praiſe, laud, and bleſſe the holy name of God.</p>
                  <p>Oh holy, holy, holy, Lord God ever praiſed and magnified be thy great name, who haſt ſet us apart to life and ſalvation, and rejected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others in the world: Yea beloved, as God hath put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and others, we belonging to his election, ſo let us manifeſt and make it to appear, that there is a difference between us and them in the courſe of our lives and converſations, that we differ from the wicked manners of the world, for they that follow the courſe and manners of the world, they believe not that God hath ſet them apart to life and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if they had hearts to believe it, they would manifeſt it, and make it appear in their lives and converſations, our life muſt be a viſible diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and diſavowing of their lives; we muſt confront the wicked, we muſt ſhine as lights in the world, and carry our ſelves as children of the light, and not follow the ſwaggering faſhions of the world; for as God hath made a ſeparation between us and them, and will make a final ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at the day of Judgement; ſo now there ſhould be a ſeparation: I mean not a ſeparation from the Church, but from the curſed courſes of the world; even as Lot did in Sodom: Oh therefore in the fear of God, let us ever magnifie and bleſſe the Name of God, for chooſing us to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and let us labour to be anſwerable in ſome meaſure by our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto him.</p>

                  <p>That not the works of man (whatſoever they be, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                     </label> ) no not the good works of men, have any hand or ſtroke in Gods election of ſome to life and glory in heaven, and his effectual calling of ſome in time, theſe two things they are merely and onely, of the free grace of God, and not of the works of man, whatſoever their works be, be they never ſo good, or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent works in themſelves. And this being the propoſition, (that it may rightly be conceived, and that we erre not in the beginning,) we muſt know, that Gods grace in Scripture hath a threefold acception.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is taken for Gods free favour, which is of the nature of God, and eſſential unto him, the places of Scripture are obvious and plain unto us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The grace of God in Scripture, it is taken for the working of grace, ſo ſome Divines take it, for the operation, extending, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out that free favour unto others.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is taken for the gifts of grace, whether thoſe gifts be habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, or actual, as faith, love, joy, hope, peace, patience, and the like; theſe are ſtiled by the name of grace; now the propoſition that we deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is, That Gods election is of his free grace, my meaning is, it is not the gifts of grace; but by grace, we are to underſtand the free grace and favour of God, and the reaching and extending of that grace in time; ſo that (this being premiſed) the point is to be thus conceived, That Gods eternal election of ſome to life and glory in heaven, it is of the free grace and favour of God, being extended and reached out to his choſen, and not of the works of man, be they never ſo good or excellent, though they be the works of grace; and for the proof of this, it is manifeſt in Rom. 11.5. The Apoſtle ſaith, that at this very day, there is a certain remnant of the Jews under the election of grace; then he ſubjoyneth in the ſixth verſe, <hi>Now if it be of grace, then not of works, for then were grace no grace; and if of works, then not of grace, for then were works no more works:</hi> ſo that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle maketh a flat oppoſition, and a contrariety, between works and grace, that the one of theſe being admitted, and granted, the other cannot ſtand, but muſt fall; grace and works cannot ſtand together in the ſame caſe: Epheſ. 2.8, 9. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>by grace you are ſaved, through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God;</hi> and then he ſubjoyneth, <hi>not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt:</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of God, ſaith, <hi>he hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own eternal purpoſe and grace:</hi> and Titus 3.4, 5. <hi>VVhen the bountifulneſſe and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe that we had done, but of his own mere mercy he ſaved us.</hi> Theſe and many others, do ſufficiently evidence unto us the truth of the point, That Gods free grace and favour, is the cauſe of eternal election, and not the works of men; which are but <hi>ſplendida peccatam,</hi> glittering ſins.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Verſe our Apoſtle putteth down the ſpeech of God unto Rebekah, which we read of in Gen. 25.23. the Holy Ghoſt in that Chapter, telleth us that Rebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kah having conceived twins, two children in her womb, and feeling the children to ſtrive in her womb, ſhe went to ask counſel of the Oracle of God, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that matter, and the text ſaith, God gave her this Anſwer, <hi>two Nations are in thy womb, Rebekah,</hi> two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of people ſhall be divided out of thy bowels, and the one people ſhall be mightier then the other, <hi>the elder ſhall ſerve the younger,</hi> theſe were the very words of God. Now theſe words our Apoſtle bringeth to prove, that Gods promiſe of mercy, grace, righteouſneſſe, life and ſalvation, did not, nor doth not, belong to all that came of Abraham and Iſaac by the courſe of Nature, and that all Gods promiſes appertained not to the Iſraelites; for, ſaith the Apoſtle, before thoſe children, (which Rebekah had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in her womb by Iſaac our Father,) before they were born, when they had neither done good nor evil, It was thus ſaid unto Rebekah, The elder of thy children ſhall ſerve the younger; therefore thoſe promiſes of God belong not to all that came of Abraham and Iſaac by courſe of nature.</p>
               <p>Now the words of this verſe they are thus to be conceived, That it was ſaid unto Rebekah even by God himſelf, that the elder of her children ſhould ſerve the younger, and ſhould be in ſubjection to the younger, and that the younger ſhould rule over the elder: And that this ſhould be made good, both perſonally in their perſons, and alſo hiſtorically in the Idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means, or Edomites which came of Eſau, and in the Iſraelites, which came of Jacob: yea I (withal) farther ſhewed you in laying open theſe words, that theſe words had not onely a reſpect to a temporal Dominion and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, the one ſhould be a lord, and the other a ſervant; but they had a ſpiritual meaning, and had reſpect to things concerning ſalvation and damnation; and under theſe words, <hi>the elder ſhall ſerve the younger,</hi> we muſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108302:51"/> underſtand, that the one of Rebekahs children was choſen to ſalvation, and the other refuſed and caſt off to damnation, ſo that we are thus to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the meaning of theſe words.</p>
               <p>Now (to come to ſtand upon the verſe more particularly) you ſee here, our Apoſtle affirmeth it was thus ſaid unto Rebekah, even by God himſelf who cannot lye, the elder of thy children ſhall ſerve the younger. I will not curiouſly ſtand here to ſearch in what manner, or how the Lord made this known unto Rebekah, touching the different eſtate of her children, whether by dream, by viſion, by Urim, or Prophet, a certain truth it is ſhe received ſuch an Oracle from God, the Apoſtle affirmeth it, that it was thus revealed by God who cannot lye, he did manifeſt and make known thus much unto Rebekah, when ſhe was thus with child with her two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that the elder ſhould ſerve the younger, and that the one was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the other rejected; which thing (without queſtion) when Rebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kah heard it, no doubt it troubled her much, ſhe not being without natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection; for a woman having two children in her womb, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Anſwer from God conſulting with him, <hi>that the one was received of God, and the other rejected and caſt off,</hi> it would be a hard Anſwer: For a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to conſider, ſurely one of my children is an elect child of God, and the other a reprobate, ſo doubtleſſe it was a very unwelcome, and a harſh and a very unpleaſing anſwer unto her; and yet we find, that this good woman did not once mutter or reaſon againſt that Anſwer which was given unto her, we find not one ſuch thing in the Book of God: ſhe might have thought, alas, what? one of my children reprobated to be damned in hell; but ſhe never uttered a word againſt this Anſwer of God, but quieted her ſelf in the good will of God revealed unto her, and contented her ſelf in the good will and pleaſure of God thus delivered unto her. Indeed we find, that afterwards ſhe ſet her love upon Jacob chiefly, and uſed means, (though ſhe failed in it,) as appeareth in Gen. 27.6. to the 14. ſhe uſed means to get the ſpecial bleſſing, ſhe took away her chief love from Eſau, and ſet it upon her ſon Jacob, her youngeſt ſon, that ſhould be lord over his brother, and therein ſhe followed the good will of God, yet we find ſhe did not once open her mouth to mutter againſt the good will of God for her ſon Eſau's rejection.</p>
               <p>Her example is imitable, it is to be imitated and followed of us; we are according to the example of this holy woman Rebekah, to reſt and to quiet our ſelves in the good will of God made known unto us, touching the things that concern our ſelves, or our children, or thoſe that belong unto us; and not anſwer, or open our mouthes to mutter againſt this good will of God, though it ſeem clean croſſe and contrary to our corrupt reaſon, but to quiet our ſelves in God, and not to repine againſt him; for it is a bitter fruit of our curſed corruption, for a man, or a woman to mutter and reaſon againſt the good Will of God, in ſuch things as are harſh and hard, and unpleaſing unto us. As (to keep to the point) if ſo be a Mother, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon her little Infant, lying in her lap, born of her body, have thus thought, Alas my poor Babe, I make much of thee, I tender thee, I nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh thee, I dandle thee, and yet it may be thou art a reprobate, it may be thou art rejected of God, it may be thou ſhalt one day become a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand of hell; this is impious and monſtrous, and not to be thought on, for it is a ſecret, and ſecret things belong to the Lord, Deut. 29.29. (nay what do I propound this?) For ſome women there be, that have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thus much; this hath been their very thought: they have thought, I nouriſh thee my child, and cheriſh and dandle thee, and yet it may be thou art not a child of God, but a reprobate; this is wicked and impious, and this is to go beyond our compaſſe, to know whether the poor infant belongeth unto God, or no, for ſecret things belong unto God, Deut. 29.29. and we are not to meddle with them: what if the Lord ſhould ſay
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108302:52"/> unto a mother, as he ſaid unto Rebekah, this little infant of thine that thou doeſt make ſo much of, I have caſt it out, and have refuſed it, it is a reprobate, it is out of my love and favour, we are then after the example of this woman Rebekah, to truſt confidently in this Will of God revealed, with contentation, and not to mutter, no not in our very ſecret thoughts: for the Will and Counſel of God, though it be many times ſecret, yet aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly it is ever juſt, yea that that is revealed unto us in the holy Word of God, concerning the matters of duty, or practiſe, or faith, or whatſoever it is, we muſt reſt upon it, and not mutter againſt it.</p>
               <p>Come we now to ſtand upon the ſpeech of God himſelf, <hi>the elder ſhall ſerve the younger;</hi> theſe words being underſtood, (as before we have heard) they do afford unto us two things of ſpecial good uſe and conſequence; as firſt of all, it being thus ſpoken to Rebekah, and that according to Gods eternal purpoſe, and unchangeable Decree, even of him that cannot lye; the Doctrine hence is this,</p>

Again, art thou poor in regard of the outward good things of this life, thou haſt ſcarce from hand to mouth to feed thy body and belly withal; know, it is the will of God thou ſhouldſt have but little, and thou art to be contented with it, and be as thankful for this as thou wouldeſt for a richer, and ever reſt contented; take heed of whining and repining, Oh I ſhall come to beggery, I ſhall come to the almes of the Pariſh; but learn thy duty, to be contented with the eſtate and portion that cometh by the appointment of God, and withal conſider two things:</p>

                     </label> That Gods decree touching his election of ſome unto life and glory in heaven, it is a moſt powerful, and a moſt effectual Decree; exceeding great is the efficacy and force of Gods eternal election. And this may eaſily be conceived ſo to be, that the election of God is ſo effectual and powerful, and ſo full of efficacy, if ſo be we duly conſider the fruits and effects of it, it is ſo effectual, that it altereth both the Law of Nature, and the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature: as firſt of all, Gods election, it altereth the law of nature; that appeareth in this example of Jacob and of Eſau: for whereas by the law of Nature, the younger ſhould ſerve the elder, and the elder ſhould have dominion over the younger; now you ſee, by the eternal purpoſe and decree of God touching election, the elder is made ſubject unto the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the younger is advanced above the elder. Again, Gods eternal election, it altereth alſo the corruption of Nature, as we may eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in this example of Jacob and Eſau; for Jacob being one belonging to Gods election, God wrought upon him by his Spirit, God ſet him out of the ſtate of Nature into the ſtate of grace, they being both in one eſtate by Nature, conceived and born in ſin alike, yet Gods eternal electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on maketh a ſeparation between them, it leaveth the one in the eſtate of Nature, and calleth the other in the ſtate of grace, yea in time it changeth the corrupt nature of man, and it correcteth the ſtubbornneſſe of Nature, and in time it bringeth forth an alteration and a change in the ſoules of men, it changeth them in time; from what? even from the ſtate of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and unbelief, and hardneſſe of heart, and diſobedience to the will of God; it changeth them into ſaving faith, ſaving knowledge, ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, pliableneſſe to the Will of God, and holy obedience to the will of God in all things; ſo powerful, and ſo effectual is Gods eternal ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And to prove this a little further, Firſt of all, this is that which God himſelf ſpeaketh of in Ezek. 36.26. where the Lord ſaith, he would take away the ſtony hearts out of his people, (out of what people? ſuch as belonged to his election,) and give unto them a heart of fleſh: to this purpoſe alſo is that, in Act. 13.48. where the text ſaith, that as many of the Gentiles as were ordained to eternal life, they believed, when they heard Paul and Barnabas preach unto them, ſuch was the force of their preordination, and fore-appointing to eternal life and ſalvation, as that it wrought in them this alteration, upon the preaching of the Goſpel, it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108302:53"/> them from unbelief, to ſaving faith; and in Epheſ. 1.4. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God hath choſen us in Chriſt, before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love;</hi> plainly teaching us this very point, that true knowledge, true faith, true holineſſe, they are fruits, neceſſarily following upon Gods eternal election, God having choſen us to this end, he is not fruſtrate of his end, but it cometh to paſſe. And hence it is the Apoſtle calleth ſaving faith, the faith of Gods elect, as a thing properly belonging to Gods elect, and a proper fruit of Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal election, Titus 1.1. and in 1 Pet. 1.2. the Apoſtle telleth thoſe to whom he writeth his Epiſtle, that they were elect of God, according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God, unto ſanctification of the Spirit. Thus we ſee it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and plain unto us, that indeed, ſo powerful and ſo effectual, is Gods eternal election, as that it altereth the Law of Nature, and the corruption of nature, and in time it bringeth forth in alteration and change in the ſoul of man, changing from the ſtate of ignorance and rebellion, to ſaving knowledge, and ſaving faith, ſoftneſſe of heart, and holy obedience.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Apoſtle in this Verſe maketh known whence it was that there ſhould be ſuch a great difference between theſe two brethren, Jacob and Eſau; he giveth this reaſon of it, namely, that it was from the love of God to the one, and Gods hatred of the other, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle citing a Text of Scripture to this purpoſe, Mal. 1.2, 3. ſo that in this verſe our Apoſtle doth explain and expound the place of <hi>Geneſis, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger,</hi> by this place of Malachy, ſhewing the reaſon of the difference, that it pleaſed God to put between theſe two brethren, proceeding from Gods love, and hatred. In a word, in this thirteenth verſe, there be two things in general to be conſidered; Firſt, the Apoſtles citing of Scripture, <hi>As it is written;</hi> Secondly, the teſtimony of Scripture, which he alledgeth in the words following, <hi>I have loved Iacob, and hated Eſau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, in that he alledgeth Scripture, <hi>As it is written,</hi> yet the Apoſtle doth not cite, either Book, Chapter, or Verſe, but putteth it down in the general: whence I might ſtand to ſhew, that we ought be ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Scripture, that when the text of Scripture is alledged, though the Book, the Chapter, or Verſe be not cited, we ſhould be able to know it was Scripture; and not to think as ſome ignorant perſons do, that when a Poet is cited that it is Scripture; but this was handled in the eighth Chapter, verſ. 36.</p>
               <p>But onely one thing further, You ſee the Apoſtle here, whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was Divine, Apoſtolical, and infallibly guided by the Holy Spirit of God, who could not erre in what he taught and delivered to the Church and people of God, yet for all this Divine and Apoſtolical, and infallible aſſiſtance, he followeth the rule of the written Word of God, and bringeth teſtimony of Scripture to prove his Doctrine; this was an uſual thing with the bleſſed Apoſtle, in other places of Scripture, read Acts 26.22, 23. the Apoſtle there ſaith, that he <hi>witneſſed to ſmall and great, ſaying no other things, then thoſe that Moſes and the Prophets did ſay ſhould come to paſſe, That Chriſt ſhould ſuffer death, and be the firſt that ſhould riſe again from the dead, and ſhew light to the Gentiles.</hi> Rom. 1.2. the Apoſtle affirmeth, that the Goſpel which he preached, was grounded upon the written Word of God, and (not to amplifie the point,) the Scripture is of ſacred and divine authority, as it containeth in it a Divine and heavenly Doctrine, yea ſuch a Doctrine that is not ſubject to the Church, or any other thing in heaven or earth, but only unto God whoſe Will and Counſel it is, touching things that concern the good of his Church and choſen.</p>
               <p>This (for the uſe of it) ſerveth to diſcover unto us the ſhameleſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> of that ſhameleſſe ſtrumpet, the Antichriſtian Synagogue of Rome, in that that Synagogue taketh upon it an abſolute power to judge in all matters of Faith, and of Religion, and to define of it, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and beſides Scripture, yea it taketh upon it a power to judge of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelf, and of the ſenſe of Scripture, and that without the help of Scripture, to faſten a ſenſe upon the written Word of God, and to ſay, this is the ſenſe, though they have no ground nor warrant for it in all the Book of God beſides, and that forſooth upon a ſuppoſition of the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſiſtance of the Spirit: Oh (ſay the Papiſts) our Church, and our Teachers, are infallibly aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, and would ground themſelves upon that Text in John 16.13. where Chriſt ſaith unto his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108302:55"/> Diſciples, when the Spirit of truth ſhould come which he would ſend, it ſhould lead them into all truth: Oh (ſay they) ſee, Chriſt promiſeth his Spirit to lead them into all truth, ſo that they cannot erre in that which they teach: But the Papiſts are miſtaken, if ſo be we conſider the place duly, and look upon it and examine it, we ſhall find it will bear no ſuch concluſion, that the Church, and the Teachers of the Church, are ſo led, that they cannot erre, in whatſoever they teach, and that the Church hath power, and the teachers of the Church power, to judge of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the ſenſe of Scripture, without the help of it, for that place in John, it muſt (of neceſſity) be underſtood with a reſtraint, when he ſaith, it ſhall lead you into all truth, it hath a limitation and reſtraint, to that ſubject, of which it is ſpoken of all that truth. For why? I hope the Papiſts will not deny, but eaſily confeſſe and yeeld unto it, that the time of Chriſt his ſecond coming to Judgment, is a certain truth of God, God hath appointed and ſet it down, in Act. 17.31. a day wherein he will judge the whole world in righteouſneſſe by Jeſus Chriſt, yet the time of his coming unto Judgment, is not revealed by the Spirit of God, to the Church or Teachers of it; nay we are not to enquire into the time of his coming, Chriſt forbiddeth it, ſo that ſpeech (of truth) muſt admit of a limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not of all truth, for here is a particular truth not revealed, but it is to be underſtood of all truths contained in the will of God, in the Scripture, that the holy Spirit of God ſhall lead them into all that truth; how may it appear? why read the place it ſelf, John 16.13, 14. <hi>Howbeit when he is come, which is the Spirit of truth, he will lead you into all truth;</hi> (there they ſtay) but mark what followes, <hi>He ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatſoever he ſhall hear, ſhall he speak, and he will ſhew unto you the things to come, and ſhall glorifie me.</hi> Now a ſpecial part of the glory of God, and Chriſt, what is it but this; that the Holy Ghoſt revealeth unto the people of God the ſecrets of the Goſpel, the things that eye of man cannot ſee, nor heart conceive, doth the Spirit of God reveal to Gods children, and doth teach what Chriſt is in himſelf, in his nature, in his offices, and in his perſon, onely theſe things he ſhall reveal, no new coyned doctrine, or new devices of mens brrains, not contained in the holy Scripture, but ſuch as Chriſt, and the Prophets, and Apoſtles have taught, theſe things ſhall be brought to the minds of Gods choſen; therefore it is monſtrous and ſhameleſſe impudencie for the Papiſts thus to affirm, that they have power without, and beſides Scripture. But we are not to believe any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they can ſay, <hi>Scriptum eſt;</hi> it is written, it is the infallible truth of God, grounded on Divine authority; thus muſt all Miniſters do, ground their doctrine on the truth of God.</p>

And they are here brought to manifeſt and to ſhew the reaſon of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that it pleaſed God to put, between the two brethren, Jacob and Eſau; Jacob advanced over Eſau, becauſe God loved Jacob; Eſau brought in ſubjection unto Jacob, becauſe God hated Eſau.</p>
                  <p>Now that we may come to the handling of this teſtimony; Some there be that ſay, this teſtimony of the Prophet <hi>(I have loved Iacob, and hated Eſau,)</hi> concerned onely things appertaining to this life, things outward and temporal, and not things eternal, the Prophet (ſay they) ſhewing wherein Gods love did conſiſt unto Jacob, and wherein his hatred unto Eſau did conſiſt; he ſaith Gods love did conſiſt in this, in giving unto Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob a fruitful Land flowing with milk and honey; and his hatred unto Eſau,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108302:55"/> in making Eſaus Mountain waſte; and in giving unto Eſau's poſterity the Idumeans, a barren and a dry Country, and a Wilderneſſe for Dragons, as the Prophet ſpeaketh; therefore (ſay they) the Prophet thus ſpeaking of things appertaining to this life, outward and temporal, it cannot hence be concluded, that our bleſſed Apoſtle treateth of eternal election, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; (as you would make it, that this whole Chapter concerneth Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination,) Now to this we anſwer eaſily; 'tis true indeed, the Prophet in the place alledged in the 1. of Malachy, ſpeaketh of things appertaining to this life, it cannot be denyed; but yet he ſpeaketh not of thoſe things onely; he ſpeaketh of thoſe external things, but not onely of thoſe things: For the drift of the Apoſtle in that place was, to reprove the Jews for their unthankfulneſſe to God; In that they did neither honour God, nor fear him; for ſaith God, Mal. 1.6. <hi>If I be a Father, where is mine honour? If I be a Maſter, where is my fear?</hi> (who had indeed loved them effectually,) and teſtified his love, in giving them a fruitful Land, even the Land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and in the ſequel, he goeth on in a further matter, and ſheweth that God was angry with Eſau for ever, but he would be glorified, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Jacob, and in the borders of Iſrael, as appeareth in the fourth and fifth Verſes. And therefore that teſtimony of the Prophet, is not to be ſo applyed, onely to things outward and temporal; for the Lord ſaith, he would be glorified in Jacob, and he had hated Eſau for ever: but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the matter of eternal election and reprobation, of which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in this Chapter treateth. Come we now to the particular unfolding of theſe words, <hi>I have loved Iacob, and hated Eſau.</hi> Gods love, it is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in God, it is of the ſame Nature with himſelf; <hi>God is love,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 Joh. 4.16. and ſo Gods love it is free, even as his own bleſſed Majeſtie, and it being extended and reached out unto man, it is the free and eternal motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (ſo I may deſcribe it) the free and eternal motion of Gods good will and pleaſure; the free motion, and the eternal motion of Gods good pleaſure, touching the eternal and everlaſting good of man: God freely purpoſing and determining the everlaſting good of man, out of his good will and pleaſure, as the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly in Epheſ. 1.5. we are predeſtinated, to be adopted through Chriſt, and that through the good pleaſure of his will: ſo then when God ſaith, I have loved Jacob, what is his meaning? I have freely, out of my own good will and pleaſure, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moving me thereunto, I have freely and voluntarily from everlaſting, decreed the everlaſting good of Jacob, and his eternal ſalvation: And I have hated Eſau, ſaith the text; Now here ſome ſtumble, and do think, that this was ſpoken, not ſimply, but comparatively; not ſimply, I have hated Eſau, but comparatively: and for this they ſay, God indeed loved Jacob and Eſau both, though he loved not Eſau with the ſame degree of love as he loved Jacob, but with a leſſe love; and therefore it is ſaid, I have hated Eſau: and they inſtance in Deut. 21.15. where the Lord ſaith by Moſes, If a man hath two wives, (as in the Old Teſtament many of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks had) the one is loved, and the other hated; this God ſpeaketh, not that a man that hath two wives hateth either, but that he loveth the one not ſo well as the other: as, Jacob had Rachel and Leah, he loved Leah with a leſſe love then he did Rachel, ſo that in compariſon of Gods love to Jacob, Gods love to Eſau was a hatred. But beloved, theſe are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly deceived, for the Apoſtle calleth thoſe whom God hateth, in the 22. verſe of this ninth Chapter of the Romans, veſſels of the wrath of God, and his vengeance, and therefore they are hated ſimply, being veſſels of his wrath to deſtruction. And if we look in that text of Malachy alledged, and duly conſider it, we ſhall find upon due examination, that it will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, that God hated Eſau ſimply, Mal. 1.2. ſaith the Lord, I have ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Eſau; and he doth exemplifie and make it appear that he hated Eſau, in that he laid his Mountain waſte, and a Wilderneſſe for Dragons; as if
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108302:56"/> he had ſaid, I have ſpoyled Eſau of all his goods, ſtripped him and turned him out naked, and I have given his fair palaces, and goodly houſes, for to be a den for Dragons; if there had been any hope of Eſau's coming to his habitation and palace, and ancient poſſeſſion, then it may haply ſeem, God did not hate Eſau ſimply, but comparatively, but go on with the text, Mal. 1.4. ſaith God, <hi>Though Edom ſay, we are impoveriſhed, and caſt out, and undone, but we will return and build the deſolate places, yet, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, they ſhall build, but I will deſtroy, and they ſhall be called, The border of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the people with whom the Lord is angry for ever,</hi> that is, againſt whom he proceedeth in wrath, and Judgment for ever. Oh ſee, is this hatred but in compariſon? (the Lord ſetting himſelf ſo purpoſely and profeſſedly againſt Eſau,) no, it is ſimply.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ſimple meaning of the words, <hi>I have hated Eſau,</hi> we muſt know, hatred in Scripture, applyed unto God, it is not a diſordered, inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, and diſtempered paſſion, as it is in us: but hatred, (applyed unto God in Scripture) it ſignifieth three things,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It ſignifieth a negation, a denial of Gods love, that God loveth not, and chooſeth not ſome to life and ſalvation; that is the firſt ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hatred in Scripture applyed unto God, it ſignifieth a juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing of puniſhment for ſin, and an inflicting of puniſhment for ſin, yea he hateth the wicked themſelves, Pſal. 5.5. <hi>thou hateſt all the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it ſignifieth Gods utter abhorring and diſliking of that which is directly againſt Gods holy and righteous Law, and ſo God is ſaid to hate iniquity and ſin, as the breach and tranſgreſſion of his moſt holy law; ſo then the meaning of God in theſe words is this; <hi>I have loved Jacob, and hated Eſau,</hi> as if the Lord had ſaid, I have, and that out of my good will and pleaſure decreed, and from everlaſting purpoſed, the eternal good of Jacob, and his ſalvation; and I have not, out of that good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of mine from everlaſting, ſo purpoſed and decreed Eſau's eternal good; nay, I have before the world was, in my ſecret counſel, rejected him, and have caſt him off, and refuſed him.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to ſuch things as are obſerveable from hence: and firſt of all obſerve, the Apoſtle here maketh the ground of the advancement of Jacob over his brother Eſau, to be Gods love to Jacob, in that he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before Eſau: hence we may gather this concluſion,</p>

Numb. 23.5. when Balaam thought to curſe the people of God, God turned it to a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: ſo I might inſtance in many particulars, how the Lord manifeſted his love unto his people, one for all, Joh. 3.16. where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>God ſo loved the world, or his choſen in the world, that whoſoever believed in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life:</hi> the free love of God was it that moved God to ſend his Son to be a Saviour unto them.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:108302:56"/> they have all good things vouchſafed unto them, for Chriſt his ſake; even for Chriſt his ſake God is pleaſed to vouchſafe unto them pardon of ſin, and all other dependents thereon; for we muſt know, that though God out of his free love decreed to make Chriſt a means, and a Saviour, by whom, and through whom, men ſhould have pardon of their ſins conveyed unto them, that he ſhould be the conduit and perſon, that they ſhould receive it by; yet the fountain, and chief ground is Gods eternal love; ſo that the firſt cauſe, the firſt ground of all good things that come unto Gods choſen here, and hereafter in heaven, it is Gods free love, and his free good will and pleaſure, though Chriſt be the means of conveyance.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1:</label> manifeſt, between Gods love unto us, and our love unto others; we love others in reſpect of ſome good, ſome worth we ſee, ſome good quality, ſome excellent and worthy thing in them, which doth attract, and draw our love unto them, we ſee ſome beauty, ſome wit, ſome learning, ſome ſtrength, or the like, that draweth our love unto them, and knitteth our hearts unto them; and indeed we are bound ſo to do, to love others, in reſpect of their beauty, wit, learning, and the Image of God in them in any manner. Now with God there is no ſuch matter, our love is bounded and grounded and ſet upon ſome excellency or worth in the creature, even our very enemies, but with God there is no ſuch matter, his love is not ſtirred up, nor cauſed by any good worth or excellency in us, or any goodneſſe in us, no not by any thing out of himſelf. Indeed I grant, God loveth his own Image, being renued in us, and the more we are renued of God, the more holy, the more religious, the more pleaſing to God, and the more dear and pretious to him: God loveth his own Image in us actually, but the cauſe of that is his eternal free love; ſo that though the Lord love us, we being renued, and holy and righteous, yet the cauſe is his eternal free love, which proceedeth not from any thing out of himſelf, but onely his free good will and pleaſure.</p>

I anſwer, Labour thou in the firſt place, to get thy part in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, labour thou to apprehend and apply the merits of Chriſt his death and obedience to thine own ſoul, by a true ſaving faith, and never reſt untill thou haſt a true and a ſaving faith to apply and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108302:57"/> the merits of Chriſt to thy ſoul; for in Chriſt alone is the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual right and title of all good things applyed to Gods choſen. Secondly, having gotten this, labour thou to find, that the outward good things of this life, they do ſtirre thee up and provoke thee forward to love God, to fear God, to walk humbly before the Lord, and to be thankful unto his holy Majeſty; the outward good things of this life, thou haſt a true right and title unto them, and are means to help thee forward in the wayes of God, and to walk humbly before the Lord, thy meat, thy drink, thy appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, are means to help thee forward to thy ſalvation, and to further thee in the way of ſalvation. And it is not with thee after the manner of the men of the world, to abuſe the good things of this life, to vanity and pride, to ſet out their hearts, in pride of apparel, gariſhneſſe of attire, riot, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, (as ſome do) that a man may ſay, and eaſily diſcern, there is a proud perſon; (however you will ſay, under a ruſſet coat may be a proud heart,) yet a man may ſay, where there is ſmoke, there is fire: It breaketh out in their foreheads, and foretops, and in their long ſhag'd ruffian-like hair, and in their exteriour parts, a man may ſay they are clothed with cruelty, and pride hangeth as a chain about their necks,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.6.</note> and their houſes and lands are priviledged places, for all manner of abomination, impiety, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe, and no man may ſpeak againſt them, eſpecially being men of place and authority, great men, their greatneſſe doth priviledge their places and houſes, for all manner of impious and abominable courſes; Oh take heed thou uſe not thy wealth as they do, but the more bountiful the Lord is, in pouring his bleſſings upon thee, the more humble thou art, the more holy thou art, the more thy heart is inlarged with righteouſneſſe, and in walking before God, and in all thankfulneſſe, yea thereby thou art made ready and fit for every good work, thy heart is not lock't up to choak the ſeed of the Word in thy heart, but they open thy heart and thy hand, and make thee ready to every good work, to reflect upon the poor mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, the more thou haſt, the more abundant thou art in good works, then certainly thou mayeſt conclude, that God hath bleſſed thee with thy wealth, and they are teſtimonies of Gods love to thee, and God hath manifeſted his love unto thee, which he bare before the world was, and thou mayeſt certainly conclude God loveth thee indeed.</p>

                     </label> I, but ſome may ſay, doth not the Scriptures point out, that though Gods children be now beloved of God, yet there was a time when they were enemies of God, as in Rom. 5.10. yea, doth not the Apoſtle ſay in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108302:57"/> Epheſ. 2.3. that they were children of wrath; how can it be then, that no time can be pointed out, when they were hated of God?</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, the Scripture doth note out this unto us, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> that they are by nature children of wrath as well as others, and we are to believe it to be a truth, That Gods choſen before their effectual calling and converſion, are enemies to God, and God is an enemy unto them, before their effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling and converſion, in reſpect of ſin, and becauſe of ſin, which is oppoſite and contrary to good, and to God himſelf which is good, yet even then Gods choſen are beloved of God, in regard of election, and even then God loveth his elect before their effectual calling, as his elect uncall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with that degree of his love, which he beareth to his elect uncalled; yea, God maketh it appear manifeſtly, that he loveth them as his elect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, in that he giveth unto them in time, true repentance; for if he did not love them, he would not give them repentance, and therefore they were then beloved of God, as his elect, in time to be called, and he doth work upon them in time, ſaving grace, true converſion, true faith and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, which are things tending to life and ſalvation; and doth he give theſe to reprobates? as teſtimonies of his love to them he loveth not? no certainly he doth not: and therefore certainly we may reſolve upon this, That God loveth his elect from everlaſting, and no time can be given when he loved them not.</p>
                  <p>Upon this ground it followeth, that the Anabaptiſts, and other ſuch <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> erring ſpirits are deceived, in that they hold this, as their tenent, that God doth purpoſe and decree the ſalvation of ſome before the world was, but God doth onely then actually chooſe them, when he ſeeth faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in them: For if this were true, ſurely then God loveth not any ſinner to life and ſalvation, till he ſeeth repentance in them, which is clean contrary to the truth of God now delivered, That no time can be given, wherein God loved not his choſen.</p>
                  <p>This being ſo, that no time can be given wherein God loved not his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> ſurely then upon this ground we may conclude to our comfort, we being ſuch that belong to Gods election, that Gods love ſhall be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us for ever: as Gods love unto us, unto life and ſalvation, hath no beginning, but is eternal, ſo alſo it ſhall be without end; as we cannot point out the time of beginning, no more can we of the continuance; but as God hath loved us from everlaſting, ſo doubtleſſe he goeth on not only within his own bleſſed Majeſtie, but in his love to us he goeth on conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, without alteration, or ſhadow of changing, Joh. 13.1. <hi>whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, he loveth unto the end:</hi> ſo that this may be a ground of ſweet and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent comfort to as many as find themſelves wrought upon by the Spirit of God, and find Gods love ſhed abroad in their hearts; that Gods love is everlaſting for the beginning and continuance of it.</p>
                  <p>Now proceed we further, <hi>I have loved Jacob, and hated Eſau;</hi> here we ſee that as Gods love to Jacob, was the cauſe of Jacobs advancement, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence; ſo Gods hatred to Eſau, was the cauſe of Eſau's ſervitude and ſubordination: hence I might ſtand to ſhew, that Gods hatred is the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign and chief cauſe of all evils, of puniſhments that befall the wicked in this life, and hereafter; though ſin be the next and ſubordinate cauſe, yet the ſoveraign, the main, the chief, the grand and Mother cauſe, is Gods hatred: but this I will not ſtand upon, but rather note out the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular application of Gods hatred againſt Eſau; and obſerve we to that purpoſe, it is here ſaid, God hated Eſau, that particular perſon Eſau, which being underſtood as before expounded, affordeth unto us this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</p>
                  <p>That God hath from everlaſting certainly decreed the rejection of ſome particular perſons, among men, even of Eſau, and of ſuch as Eſau was: <label type="milestone">

                     </label> as God from everlaſting decreed the election of ſome to life and ſalvation,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:108302:58"/> ſo hath he alſo decreed certainly the rejection and refuſing of others, for even as he loved the one, ſo he hateth the other: And this ground of truth hath evidence and proof of it in other places of Scripture, in the 1 Theſſ. 5.9. ſaith the Apoſtle, he hath not appointed us to wrath, but that we ſhould obtain ſalvation by the means of Jeſus Chriſt, thereby im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that ſome are appointed of God to wrath, and in his eternal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, God hath appointed that ſome ſhall never come to life and ſalvation; and in 1 Pet. 2.8. the Apoſtle affirmeth that ſome there are that ſtumble at the Word of God; (which is indeed a common ſtumbling block, Gods children walk evenly with an even foot, in the waies of God according to the will of God,) but ſome there be that ſtumble, being diſobedient, unto which, before the world was, they were appointed and ordained: ſo in Jude 4. verſe, The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſome, that were of old before the world was ordained to condemnation, denying the Lord Jeſus, the Lord of life and glory. Indeed the Scripture is not ſo plentiful, in this matter of reprobation, as it is in the matter of election; and why ſo? ſurely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the purpoſe of the Holy Ghoſt in the Scripture is principally to make known unto Gods choſen, Gods eternal good will, and his eternal love, to manifeſt and to ſignifie Gods good will and good pleaſure to his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and the main and chief drift of the Holy Ghoſt, in the written Word of God, is to bring Gods choſen to certain hope of life and ſalvation, 1 Pet. 1.3. that they may be begotten to a lively hope, yet though this be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly ſet down in the matter of rejection and reprobation, yet it is ſet down plainly and ſufficiently, that God hath certainly refuſed ſome, and caſt them off for ever. And beloved, this being a high myſtery, that we may not miſconceive, or miſunderſtand it, we muſt know that there is a difference to be put, and a diſtinction to be made, between Gods decree of rejecting of ſome, and the execution of his decree; God hath decreed abſolutely from everlaſting, and before the world was, without reſpect to any thing in them, or any thing he did foreſee would be in them, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: Now the execution of his Decree, is with the reſpect of ſin, the decree is abſolute, but the execution is with reſpect had to ſinne; and for ſin doth God execute his wrath in time, upon thoſe that were rejected before time, for their infidelity, and their ſin foregoing, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cauſe of damnation, and no man is damned but for ſin.</p>

                     </label> yet I will onely commend unto you two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial things that cannot poſſibly be found in a Reprobate. What are thoſe? The firſt is, a thorow and true change, both of the heart and life,<note place="margin">Two things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found in any Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</note> from evil to good: (as you heard not long ſince) Gods eternal election bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth an alteration; ſo the firſt thing muſt be this, a ſound, thorough, and true change wrought in the whole man, not in the memory, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or the tongue onely, but in the reſt, and throughout; not as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have onely left ſome ſins, as the beaſtly adulterer, for want of ability to follow it, but they are changed throughout, and have the power of grace wrought in them by the means of grace, the Word, Prayer, and the Sacraments, they have true grace wrought in every part of their body, and power of the ſoul, by the uſe of the means; for howſoever God is not tyed to means, (he can work without means,) yet God doth ordinarily work, where he vouchſafeth means: And they that live under the meanes, and have not grace, they are in a fearful caſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing that cannot be found in a Reprobate,<note place="margin">Pſal. 38.3.

Now then if thou findeſt theſe things, that thou haſt a true and thorough change, by the work of Gods Spirit, thou art able to ſtand againſt thy beſt pleaſing and darling ſinnes; and the more grace thou haſt, the more careful thou art to uſe the meanes: thou doeſt not think the time tedious, in hearing the Word, or repeating of Sermons; the more thy love to the means increaſeth, and the more thou groaneſt under ſuch evils and ſins, as no eye of man can take notice of, no not the devil, and thou accounteſt it thy greateſt miſery to bear the

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ome we now unto the 14 Verſe. Our Apoſtle having from the ſixth verſe of this Chapter, hitherto clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God from inconſtancy, from being inconſtant in his Word and Promiſes, notwithſtanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Jewes, for the body and greateſt part of them, though they be the ſeed of Abraham and Iſaac, and deſcended of Jacob, who was called Iſrael, yet God was not inconſtant; having cleared God from that imputation, now he cometh to clear God from iniquity, and injuſtice, and in this argument he continueth from this 14. verſe, to the 19. verſe of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>Now in this 14 verſe, our Apoſtle preventeth a falſe inference, and a wrong concluſion, that mans corrupt and carnal reaſon might infer and bring upon that before delivered in the verſes foregoing: For the Apoſtle having made known thus much concerning theſe two brethren, that they being equal in birth, and neither of them in better or worſe eſtate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of nature, but both in equal conditions, God hated the one, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the other; this may ſeem very hard to fleſh and bloud, and the carnal humane reaſon of man at this might ſtumble, and hereupon be offended, and riſe up in a complaint againſt God, and charge him with injuſtice and partiality, that therefore becauſe he loved Jacob, and hated Eſau, the Lord is partial in his doings: Now this inference and concluſion our Apoſtle preventeth and meeteth with, and ſheweth it to be a mere cavil of the fleſh, and a falſe and wrong concluſion, drawn from the premiſe unjuſtly, and that on this manner; this is his manner of proceeding:</p>
               <p>Firſt of all the Apoſtle knowing that that which he had delivered, was a truth, and is confident and bold in it, and doth provoke any one that doth cavil againſt him; to tell what they could ſay againſt him, or infer upon that poſition, <hi>VVhat ſhall we ſay therefore?</hi> Say what you can: he doth provoke every man, to tell him what they can ſay againſt this, God loved Jacob, and hated Eſau.</p>
               <p>Then in the ſecond place, (having made this challenge, what can we ſay and infer againſt this holy poſition,) he delivereth that concluſion, which in all likelihood, fleſh and blood was ready to make and bring in: And that by way of interrogation, <hi>is there therefore unrighteouſneſſe with God?</hi> what canſt thou ſay, is there unrighteouſneſſe with God? to this he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth Negatively, <hi>no,</hi> and that not barely, but anſwereth it by way of deteſtation and abhorring ſuch a concluſion, as groſſe and abſurd, ſaith he, <hi>God forbid:</hi> Shall we conclude, God is unrighteous? no, and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth moſt emphatically, and powerfully, and thereunto the Apoſtle ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth a further and more ſpecial denyal of that groſſe concluſion, by a more ſpecial refutation, in the 15, 16, 17, and 18. verſes; but, to keep within the compaſſe of this 14 verſe, wherein is contained the Apoſtles
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:108302:59"/> challenge, the particular concluſion, and the powerful denyal: And firſt of all briefly to open the ſenſe of the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat ſhall we ſay then?]</hi> Theſe words are to be underſtood, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; <hi>VVhat ſhall we ſay therefore?</hi> in the 13 verſe, where the Apoſtle bringeth in God ſpeaking from the teſtimony of the Prophet; <hi>I have loved Jacob, and hated Eſau;</hi> and they are thus to be conceived, <hi>VVhat ſhall we ſay therefore?</hi> ſee what concluſion we ſhall infer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is there unrighteouſneſſe with God?]</hi> Shall we hereupon bring and infer this concluſion? that therefore there is unrighteouſneſſe with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God did from everlaſting purpoſe and decree, out of his mere good will and pleaſure; Jacobs eternal ſalvation; and alſo before the world was; out of his free good will and pleaſure, (nothing moving him) Eſau's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that therefore God is unjuſt, and unequal, becauſe he ſo dealt with equal perſons, in his Juſtice and mercy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God forbid.]</hi> Oh far be it from us, let us never entertain ſuch a thought in our hearts, that God ſhould be ſo unequal, and ſo unjuſt, and that he dealt not according to the rule of equity and Juſtice. So then thus briefly conceive we the meaning of the Apoſtle,
<q>What ſhall we ſay? what concluſion ſhall we infer? that God did love Jacob, and hate Eſau, ſhall we thereupon make this concluſion and inference, that therefore God is unjuſt, and unequal, and that God proceedeth not according to the rule of equity and juſtice, (God dealing ſo unequally with perſons that be equal,) out of his mere good will and pleaſure? Oh no, far be it from us to infer that, the Lord keep us from bringing in ſuch a concluſion, ſuch an abſurd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, the Lord keep us from uttering of ſuch a thought.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Come we now to ſuch things as may be obſerved out of the words of this verſe, and may be for our inſtruction. And firſt of all, note how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident the Apoſtle is, and reſolute upon the truth of it, that he provoketh any, to tell him what he would ſay againſt it; what ſhall we infer? what inference, or what concluſion can any man bring upon this poſition, that God loved Jacob, and hated Eſau?</p>
               <p>And beloved, not to ſtand upon this, Thus confident ought we to be, in delivering the holy Word of God, and in preaching the truth of God; we are ſo to deliver Gods truth, and (eſpecially material and fundamentall truths,) that we may be able to avouch it againſt all gain-ſayers, and all that come againſt us, we muſt be able to challenge and avouch it to any man, and ſay, this is the holy and Divine truth of God; and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is that in 2 Tim. 2.15. That every Miniſter muſt ſtudy to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a workman that needs not be aſhamed, dividing the Word of truth aright; and in Titus 1.9. He doth affirm, that the Preachers of the Word muſt hold faſt the faithful Word, and let none wring it out of their hands, and that according to doctrine, that he may be able to inſtruct the people of God by wholſome doctrine, and alſo reprove them that gainſay it, and refute them, whatſoever they be, that gainſay it; thus confident ought every Miniſter of the Word to be.</p>
               <p>This ſheweth and diſcovereth unto us, <label type="milestone">

               <p>In the next place, obſerve we, our Apoſtle having delivered this holy truth of God, grounded upon the truth of God, (touching Jacob and Eſau,) he knew that ſome, out of their natural reaſon and underſtanding, would be ready to cavil againſt it, and to make a wrong concluſion of it; he knew that ſome would ſtagger at it, and wreſt and pervert the truth of God, and would draw from it this concluſion, (therefore God is unjuſt,) ſo that the Apoſtle is forced to cry out, <hi>VVhat ſhall we ſay then? is God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt?</hi> hence the obſervation is this,</p>

And for the farther manifeſtation of it, read Rom. 3.8. there it is ſaid that the Apoſtle was blamed, that he ſhould ſay, that we might do evil, that good might come thereby, Becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, that by our wicked lives God was glorified; ſo we read of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, Matth. 22.23. they laboured to pervert the truth concerning the reſurrection from the dead, and to draw from it a groſſe abſurdity, that if there were a reſurrection, how ſhould a woman that had ſeven husbands, know whoſe wife ſhe was: but Chriſt telleth them they are deceived, <hi>not knowing the Scripture:</hi> ſo in 2 Pet. 3.16. the Apoſtle ſaith ſome did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and wrong the Goſpel to their own deſtruction; and in Eſay 52.6. the Prophet ſpeaketh of the niggards, the niggard will ſpeak like the niggard, and in the middle of the verſe he ſaith, that he will ſpeak falſly againſt the Lord; he will labour to bring an untruth from the truth of God, that thereby he might have ſome ſtrength to his niggardlineſſe, that he might make hungry the weary ſoul, and cauſe the weak to fall. And (not to adde further teſtimonies of Scripture,) common experience doth ſhew the truth of it, for whence come errour and hereſies, but out of this bitter root, that men do abuſe and pervert the Scripture, and make men believe, that God ſpeaketh that in his Word which he ſpeaketh not; and make that the purpoſe of the Holy Ghoſt, which was never his purpoſe; as Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, and Separatiſts, and other erring ſpirits do; whence cometh it, but that they faſten their errours upon the Word of God? whence cometh it that men go on boldly in their ſins? but that they draw falſe concluſions from the Word of God: as in that the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 Tim. 5.8. <hi>they that provide not for their own, are worſe then Infidels:</hi> and therefore may they upon this ground, practice the damnable ſin of uſury, and extortion, and of covetouſneſſe, and of hoording up, and alſo uſe fraud, coſening and deceit, and all unlawful meanes to enrich themſelves; ſo again, ſome out of Exod. 22.25. where the Lord ſaith, <hi>thou ſhalt not oppreſſe thy brother with uſury,</hi> Oh (ſay they) I may practiſe the ſin of uſury, if I do not oppreſſe; mine is not a biting, but a toothleſſe uſury; ſo that here is a wrong concluſion to imbolden men in ſin: ſo ſome hearing the ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath,</hi> therefore (ſay they) we may upon the Sabbath uſe our recreations, and ſports, and paſtimes, and we may walk to Tavernes, and Ale-houſes: Oh what a groſſe concluſion is this, forced on the truth of God! ſo I might inſtance in many more, to ſhew how mans nature is ready to pervert the truth of God.</p>

And know, it is not enough for us, that we are taught the Word of God truly, and live under a good Preacher, a holy and faithful Miniſtery, as many do to increaſe their deep condemnation; but we muſt remember, that ſo great is the corruption of our hearts and underſtanding, our judgments are ſo perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo out of order, that indeed unleſſe they be ſanctified and renued by grace, they are ready to pervert the truth of God, and wreſt wrong concluſions, eſpecially if that doctrine be applyed home particularly, and brought home to our ſoules; if we touch their careleſſe bands, or the long ſhaggy hair of their heads, then they ſtartle and flye, and fume out againſt the truth of God: ſurely beloved, this concerneth us; for if the Word did not flye home to our hearts, to the particular ſins we are guilty of, then they would lye ſtill; but, becauſe it doth, Oh what a ſtir, what a ſtriving, what a combuſtion there is about ſuch a matter, as the ſhaggy hair, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe bands, and ſuch like. And therefore we muſt come to the truth of God with holy and ſanctified hearts, as God ſaith, Luke 8.15. <hi>the good ground that receiveth ſeed, receiveth it with an honeſt and good heart:</hi> and that thou mayeſt have it indeed, obſerve theſe two things.</p>

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Direct. 2.</note> we muſt come to the hearing and reading of the Word of God with a heart lift up unto God in prayer; as we muſt come empty of pride,

It may be thou art a man of great knowledg and wiſdom in the world, yet in compariſon of Gods wiſdom in his Word, thou art a fool, and muſt caſt away all conceit of thy own righteouſneſſe, and underſtanding, and come trembling to the Word of God, and not read it (as many do) to jeſt and make themſelves merry at it: ſhall the Lyon roar, and none of the beaſts tremble? ſhall the Word of God be read, and we jeſt at it for our merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?

I appeal to your ſelves, any reaſonable man, let him tell me, how is this unjuſt? how is this unequal, and partial dealing in God? even to the reaſon of man, if this were true? it is juſt with God to ſave a ſoul that believeth, and reject an unbeliever; this is Juſtice, here is no ſhadow or ſhew of injuſtice, and then the Apoſtle needeth not to break out in this pathetical manner; <hi>VVhat ſhall we ſay, Is there unrighteouſneſſe with God?</hi> and then the matter of election, and reprobation, would not ſeem ſo harſh and hard to fleſh and blood.

In the 15. and 16. verſes, the Apoſtle ſheweth, that God is not unjuſt, in his free choyce of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons amongſt men, to life and ſalvation; and in the 17. and 18. verſes, he ſheweth God is not unjuſt in his free and abſolute rejection of others. In the 15. verſe he cleareth God from injuſtice by a teſtimony of Scripture; and in the 16. verſe he doth conclude and determine that point. Now touching the teſtimony of Scripture in the 15. verſe, firſt, the Apoſtle makes known by whom, and to whom, it was uttered and ſpoken. Then ſecondly, he putteth down the words of the teſtimony, <hi>I will ſhew mercy to whom I will ſhew mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion.</hi> This teſtimony of Scripture is here brought by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, as a proof of this, that though God did freely, from everlaſting, (out of his own mere good pleaſure, nothing elſe moving him thereunto,) chooſe ſome men to life and ſalvation, and reject others, yet was he moſt juſt and righteous: and herein lyeth the weight and force of his Argument, That God hath free and abſolute power to ſhew mercy unto whom he will, and to deny his mercy unto whom he will; therefore he is not unjuſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous in chooſing ſome to ſalvation, and rejecting others to damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And thus you ſee the ſcope of the words, and general matter of this Verſe.</p>
               <p>Now the words of this 15. verſe are ſomewhat to be examined, <hi>For he ſaith to Moſes,</hi> (that is, God ſaid unto Moſes) <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and ſhew compaſſion to whom I will ſhew compaſſion.</hi> Theſe words, they are the words of God to Moſes, in Exodus 33.19. there we find theſe very words. And the occaſion of the uttering of theſe words to Moſes, was, upon Moſes requeſt unto God, that he might ſee Gods glory, in the 18. verſe of that Chapter. And God promiſed unto him, that he would ſhew him his back-parts; and ſo in part yeelded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his requeſt: and then he ſubjoyneth theſe very words, as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he would ſhew that favour to Moſes, and to no other man; Not for any merit, or any worthineſſe in Moſes himſelf; but out of his own mercy, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,</hi> I will ſhew this kindneſſe unto thee, (to ſee the back parts of my glory,) becauſe I will have mercy on whom I will. Now by <hi>mercy,</hi> in this text of the Apoſtle, and the other of Moſes, we are to underſtand the act, the exerciſe, and work of mercy; and by <hi>compaſſion,</hi> the act, the exerciſe, and work of compaſſion, and pity, or rather tender love; for the word <hi>compaſſion,</hi> cometh from a <hi>radix,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dilexit. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> that ſignifieth to love with ſuch a tender affection, as mothers do love their children naturally, ſuch love as the woman expreſt to her child before Solomon. And this mercy and pity being attributed, aſcribed, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:108302:63"/> given to God, it ſignifieth either a propenſion, a readineſſe of his Divine will, to help thoſe that be in miſery, (which is the eſſential, and natural property of mercy in God,) Or elſe it ſignifieth the act, and exerciſe, and the work of Gods mercy extended, and reached out unto his people; and ſo we are to underſtand it here, not the property of mercy which is natural and eſſential in God, but the extent of it to the creature. And when the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will have mercy and compaſſion on whom I will,</hi> his meaning is, the act, and exerciſe, and work of my mercy, and compaſſion, and tender love, it is ever by me extended, reached out, and exerciſed, to thoſe amongſt men, to whom I will exerciſe, extend, and reach it out, and that merely and onely of my own free will, nothing in man, or coming by man, moving me to do it: ſo then thus briefly conceive we the meaning of the Apoſtle in this verſe,
<q>God ſaith unto Moſes, in Exod. 33.19. upon Moſes requeſt unto him, (God promiſing out of his favour to him to ſhew him his back parts,) that the act, and exerciſe, and work of my mercy, is ever by me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and reached out to thoſe amongſt men to whom I will extend and reach it out, and that merely and onely of my own good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nothing in man, coming from man, moving me to reach it out, <hi>I wil have mercy on whom I will.</hi>
                  </q>

               <p>Come we now to matter of Doctrine. And beloved I cannot paſſe it by, without noting, that the Apoſtle here alledging a text of Scripture, uttered by Moſes, ſaith God ſpake it, ſo ſaith God to Moſes: whence it is clear,</p>
               <p>That the Scripture, the Word of God, the written Word of God, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> it is a ſpeaking word of efficacy, not a dumb Word; and it is Gods Oracle, as the Apoſtle calleth it, in Rom. 3.2. yea God ſpeaketh to his people and Church in and by his written Word, and in every part and parcel of it, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God ſaith unto Moſes.</hi> Indeed I grant, that God ſpake all the words of the ten Commandements, after a more ſpecial, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, Exod. 20. <hi>God ſpake all theſe words, and ſaid:</hi> but yet the whole Scripture is Gods ſpeaking Word, and Gods Oracle, yea his lively Oracle, not a dead or dumb Oracle, as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, Heb. 4.12. <hi>the Word of</hi> God is lively, and mighty in operation, <hi>ſharper then any two edged ſword;</hi> a quickening word, and a word of power: and hence it is the Prophet Eſay ſendeth the people of his time to enquire of God, Eſay 8.19, 20. ſaith he, <hi>ſhould not a people enquire of their God?</hi> then preſently he adjoyneth, <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimony,</hi> there you ſhall hear God ſpeak, and know his mind.</p>

               <p>I anſwer, the meaning of the place is, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> that the Lord hath not given any ſuch expreſſe Commandement, in any place of his Word, as the Apoſtle doth there deliver it; but the Apoſtle did gather ſo much by interpretation of the Scripture; and he ſo ſpake, as he was guided by the Spirit of God, as he ſaith in the 40 verse, <hi>(Et ipſe Spiritum dei habeam,) and I have the Spirit of God;</hi> I ſpeak it in the name of the Lord: So then this is a truth, that the Scripture is the ſpeaking Word of God, it is Gods ſpeaking word, he utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his voyce his Church in the Word.</p>

                  </label> In that they fill their mouthes full of bitter and blaſphemous ſpeeches againſt the truth of God, in that they term the holy written Word of God to be dead Ink, and a dumb Judge; ſay they, put a ſcarlet gown upon an Image, and ſee what it will ſpeak, ſo (ſay they) is the Scripture. And they ſet up other Judges in the place of Gods Word, as the authority of the Church,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:108302:64"/> or a general Convention, or the Pope ſpeaking Judicially out of his chair, ſetting him up as a Judge in all matters of controverſie, refuſing the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as inſufficient, and calling it dead Ink, and a dumb Judge. Thus they ſhew themſelves to be utter enemies of the holy written Word of God, and ſeek to cruſh the authority of it, and to ſet up the voyce of a ſinfull man, the ſon of perdition, the limb of the devil, over the Church, and to diſclaim the voyce of the living God ſpeaking to us in his holy Scripture. But we muſt learn to acknowledge and to reverence the Scripture, as Gods ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Word, and the written Word of God to be that which God uttereth to his people; and not ſay as ſome ignorant people do, Oh if God would ſpeak unto us from heaven, in his own immediate voyce, and if Chriſt would come upon the earth and preach unto us, how attentive would we be, we would not fall aſleep then at Sermons. But if thou wouldeſt know what God ſaith to his people, then come to the written Word of God. It is folly and madneſſe in the fooliſh Familiſts, (and others of that ſect,) that they depend upon Revelations beſides the written Word of God: but (not to contend with them) to apply it to our ſelves.</p>

Oh but (ſay ſome) theſe things ſometimes come to paſſe. It may be ſo in Judgment they come to paſſe, becauſe men give ear unto them: what ſaith the Lord by Moſes, Deut. 13.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. If a lying prophet, or a dreamer of dreames, do tell you of ſtrange things, and they come to paſſe, believe him not; for the Lord doth it to try you, and it is the juſt hand of God to bring it upon you, becauſe we give ear, and liking to them.</p>
               <p>Again, obſerve we the Apoſtle bringeth theſe words of Moſes, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,</hi> to prove, that God was not unjuſt in loving Jacob, and hating Eſau; he having denyed this with a <hi>God forbid,</hi> he ſubjoyneth preſently, (as a reaſon to prove it) <hi>For he ſaith to Moſes, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.</hi> A man would think this were a ſtrange kind of clearing God from injuſtice, is not God therefore unjuſt, when he loveth Jacob, and hateth Eſau without cauſe? becauſe he ſaith, I will have mercy becauſe I will; hath God no other reaſon to give? But we muſt learn to acknowledge, that this is the ſoveraign power of the great God of heaven and earth, that his will muſt be reaſon enough to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this is the true obedience that is acceptable and pleaſing to his holy Majeſtie.</p>

But to apply this a little nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and to another purpoſe, to teach us, that as we muſt juſtifie the working will of God; ſo we muſt juſtifie his ſignifying will in his Word, whereby he doth ſignifie his mind, to acknowledge that to be holy, juſt, and good, yea we muſt learn to eſteem and to hold every Commandement of God; every denunciation, threatening, and every promiſe of God, that we find in the holy book of God, to be holy, juſt, and good, Rom. 7.12. And it is a ſure ſign of grace, when we can acknowledge the wiſdom of God in his Word, and every Commandement of God to be holy and righteous, as when a man can juſtifie the Commandement of the Sabbath, the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement againſt uncleanneſſe, uſury, or any Commandment that doth croſſe and thwart, and contradict our ſins whatſoever, that we can ſay, Lord, thou art juſt and upright in thy Commandements, howſoever I am ſinfull; this is a ſign of a ſanctified ſoul: whereas every worldling will be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt every Commandement of God, and will pick a quarrel with them, at the Commandement of the Sabbath, that requireth we ſhould not think our own thoughts, ſpeak our own words, nor do our own works on that day, Eſay 58.13.

                  <p>Again, it is falſe, and utterly untrue, that this heretick affirmeth, that all the natural properties of God are ever in uſe to us for juſtice, mercy, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and power, and the like, be eſſential and natural in God, and yet God doth extend and reach them out to whom he pleaſeth, according to his own purpoſe, when he will, and where he will, and how it pleaſeth him; ſo that it is falſe and blaſphemous to ſay, that mercy is not natural, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential in God, for the teſtimony of Scripture contradicteth it; in Exod. 34.6. the Lord there proclaimeth himſelf in this manner, <hi>The Lord, the Lord, ſtrong, merciful, gratious, and abundant in goodneſſe, and in truth:</hi> yea, this might be illuſtrated by many teſtimonies of Scripture, but I forbear it in ſo pregnant and plain a truth.</p>
                  <p>And come we then to that which may be truly concluded from theſe words, <hi>I will have mercy upon whom I will, And compaſſion upon whom I will:</hi> Theſe words being underſtood, (as heretofore I have explained them,) That the act, the exerciſe, and the work of Gods mercy, and pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, it is ever by God extended to them to whom he pleaſeth: Hence then we are given to underſtand thus much,</p>

That the Lord is merciful unto any, or that he ſheweth any fruit of his love or mercy to any one, it is merely from his own good will and pleaſure, and not depending upon any thing out of his holy and bleſſed Majeſtie, the Lord being the author of mercy, pity, and compaſſion: he extendeth his mercy, pity, and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to thoſe to whom he will. Or more briefly thus, The reaſon why the Lord doth extend and reach out mercy unto any, is his mere will, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. And to clear this a little further, mark what the Apoſtle ſaith, in 2 Cor. 1.3. the Apoſtle there calleth God, <hi>Pater miſericordiarum,</hi> the Father of mercies, ſhewing, that God is the Father, and begetter of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that mercy and love are as it were his children, coming from him: and in Joh. 1.15. ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>of him we receive grace for grace,</hi> one grace to another. And Chriſt Jeſus ſaith, Luke 10.12. <hi>Father, I confeſſe, Lord of heaven and earth, thou haſt hid theſe things,</hi> (even the things of thy Goſpel,) <hi>from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed them unto babes, even ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it pleaſed thee.</hi> It was ſo of thy good will and pleaſure, nothing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

God vouchſafeth mercy to his choſen, for the ſake of Chriſt; the will of God is, that his choſen ſhould have the pardon of their ſins, through Jeſus Chriſt, and that pardon of ſin ſhould not come without Chriſt, as Chriſt affirmeth, John 6.40. <hi>for this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the ſon, and believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi>

And the reaſon why God vouchſafeth mercy to any, is nothing elſe but Gods free will.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> unto us, and nothing elſe: hereby then we muſt learn to magnifie the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God vouchſafed unto us in any kind whatſoever; hath God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed mercy unto us in regard of our bodies, but eſpecially in reſpect of our ſoules? hath he converted our ſinful ſoules from wickedneſſe to himſelf? hath he reached out his mercy ſo far, as that he hath extended his ſaving grace unto our ſoules? Oh then learn we to acknowledge, that it is moſt free, and that it hath been vouchſafed merely from God himſelf, nothing in us, as a reaſon or cauſe to move him, why he ſhould ſhew us the leaſt mercy. And thus meditate and think with thy ſelf, whoſoever thou art, that haſt found Gods mercy, and his ſaving grace reached out unto thy ſinful ſoul: Oh conſider, ſurely I was in the common eſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all men, I was guilty of damnation, by reaſon of the ſin committed by Adam, I was begotten and brought forth in ſin, and lived therein in a miſerable eſtate and condition, and I had no feeling of my miſery, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be ſaved; and when God ſought me, I deſired him not, I cloſed mine eyes againſt him, and would not ſee the light; I ſtopped mine eares, and would not hear his voyce; But the Lord at the laſt opened mine ears and eyes, and enlightened my mind, gave me underſtanding, and made me ſee, what I would not ſee; he touched my heart with his grace, and the power
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108302:66"/> of his Spirit, and changed my Affections: whereas before I had no mind of heaven, no deſire of ſalvation, untill he made me ſee what I have not; he hath not dealt thus with all: many thouſands there be that go on without this touch of heart and remorſe of conſcience, without this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful work of grace, they go on in their ſins, though they hear the Word from Sabbath to Sabbath; what was I better then they? ſurely nothing at all by Nature: Oh then how am I bound unto God, nothing moving the Lord to ſhew mercy unto me, but onely his mere good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; how am I bound to magnifie the goodneſſe of God? And indeed, this is that glory of the free mercy of God, which the Lord would have us to yeeld unto him; he would have us to yeeld unto him this glory of his free mercy: and how pleaſing this is to God, and how the Lord eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of this magnifying of his mercy, may appear by that deſcription, Exod. 34 6, 7. <hi>The Lord, the Lord, ſtrong, merciful, gracious, ſlow to anger, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in goodneſſe and truth, Reſerving mercy for thouſands forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the Lord doth proclaim himſelf, for this is that wherein the Lord doth take delight, to have the glory of his free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy given unto him. And this is the name by which the Lord Jeſus will be known to his Elect, and choſen in all ages. I am a merciful God, this is the name by which I will be magnified, and in which he delighteth that we ſhould give him the glory of his mercy, that we can ſay, when the Lord vouchſafeth mercy unto us, that it proceedeth onely from the Lords free will. And know, that it is not more vile pride in a Begger, to attribute the almes that is given unto him, unto his own deſerts, then it is for us to aſcribe any the leaſt mercy that God vouchſafeth unto us to our own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe: it is monſtrous pride in a beggar, to aſcribe the almes that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, to his own deſervings; But it is far more for thee to aſcribe and attribute that to thy ſelf, which is freely given of God: Let us therefore conſider, that every rag we have, it is of the free mercy of God: Oh did proud perſons conſider this, they would not ſo gorgiouſly adorn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and diſgrace the holy profeſſion of God: if they did conſider they have nothing but from the free Fountain of Gods mercy, nothing moving him, they would not be ſuch careleſſe fellowes in their careleſs bands, which ſheweth their careleſneſſe, as they be.</p>

Now the Lord having thus deſcribed his ſhewing of mercy merely to depend upon his good will and pleaſure; hereupon our Apoſtle in this 16. verſe, doth bring in a conſectarie, and infer this concluſion, that therefore Gods eternal election of ſome to life and ſalvation, is not to be aſcribed unto the will, or unto the works of any man, but unto Gods free grace in ſhewing of mercy, <hi>So then it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth mercy.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>in him that willeth,]</hi> That is, in him that willeth, and deſireth good, and endeavoureth after that which is good, and that by the power and ſtrength of his mind, will, and affections, or any part, or all the powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his ſoul.</p>

                  <hi>So then,</hi> or So therefore, that which we have hitherto ſpoken of, and treated on, touching Gods election of Jacob, or any particular perſon to life and ſalvation in heaven.

               <p>Come we now to matter of obſervation. And firſt of all obſerve we, the Apoſtle here bringeth in this ſixteenth verſe as a concluſion upon the fifteenth verſe: and the Apoſtle doth here apply that which he had ſet down in the verſe foregoing, by way of conſequence, by way of concluſion, and application, <hi>(So therefore)</hi> having cited that teſtimony of Scripture of God unto Moſes, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will:</hi> thereupon in this verſe our Apoſtle draweth out and bringeth in a conſequence to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>So then it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but God that ſheweth mercy;</hi> thus you ſee the Apoſtles Application: ſo then the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is this,</p>

In the 2 Tim. 4.2. the Apoſtle chargeth Timothy to preach the Word, and to open the ſecrets of the Goſpel, and not there to reſt, but to be earneſt in reproving and rebuking, and exhorting, with all long ſuffering, and doctrine, not onely preach, but ſo preach the Word, as that in preaching he be inſtant in rebuking, reproving, and exhorting, as occaſion is offered.

And I might bend my force to reprove them; but I paſſe them by, having none of them to ſpeak unto.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all, take we notice of this by way of Application to this <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> end, That the Miniſter and Preacher of the Word ought and may apply the indefinite, and general Promiſes of the Goſpel to any one particular belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for their comfort; yea he may aſſure particular perſons, that they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſhall certainly be ſaved. It is a Cavil of the Papiſts to the contrary, who are enemies to Gods grace, and all ſaving comfort; it is their doctrine and Satanical deluſion: For, ſay they, the Miniſters and Preachers of the Word know not whether that particular perſon, he ſpeaketh to, be in the number of Gods election, or no. But beloved, this skilleth not, it is not material, whether the Miniſter of God doth know it, or no; he doth not aſſure any man, that he ſhall be ſaved, becauſe he knoweth he is in the number of Gods choſen; but upon condition of believing, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition required in the Goſpel. And a Miniſter of Chriſt (according to his office) is to apply the general Promiſes of the Word to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and draw from thence matter of comfort to believing ſoules, and particularly comfort thoſe that are capable of comfort; He telleth him, that he believing in theſe promiſes, ſhall certainly be ſaved: For thus runneth the tenour of the Word, and the Goſpel, Whoſoever truly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall certainly be ſaved: hereupon the Miniſter, ſtanding in the room and place of Chriſt, being his Ambaſſadour, doth make this particular application, and draw out this concluſion, The text ſaith, <hi>he that believeth, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> The Miniſter ſaith, Believe thou Richard, Thomas, William,) or whatſoever thou art, and thou ſhalt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaved. And this is as much as if Chriſt himſelf did preach by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate voyce from heaven: For why? Chriſt hath committed to us Preachers the delivery of his Word, as appeareth, 2 Cor. 5.19, 20. And therefore upon the ground of believing the general promiſes of the Goſpel, that ſuch ſhall be ſaved, they may aſſure themſelves, they ſhall be ſaved. And a man finding faith in his heart and ſoul, which he may prove by the fruits and works of faith, may thereupon aſſure himſelf that he is in the number of Gods choſen, and ſhall certainly be ſaved. And thereupon we may ſee it is but a cavil, that theſe enemies of God affirm, That the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter knoweth not whether a man belong to Gods election, or no, when the Miniſter aſſureth him not upon that ground, but upon the ground of believing.</p>
               <p>Is this ſo, that the Miniſter of the Word muſt not onely make known <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> general Doctrines, but particularly apply them? Surely then the hearers of the VVord muſt not onely hear the general truth of the VVord made known unto them, but they muſt alſo be content to have thoſe truths ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108302:68"/> unto them, particularly, by way of inſtruction, by way of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by way of juſt reproof, as occaſion is offered. And (beloved) men muſt not ſtart aſide, and fret and chafe, and take on, when that the truth of the word is brought home unto them, and applied particularly unto their ſouls, for the diſcovery of their particular ſins: as their pride and vanity of apparel, or whatſoever it is, no, they muſt willingly, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and readily yield and ſubmit themſelves unto it, and not begin to quarrel with the affection of the Preacher, and ſay, now he ſpeaketh out of malice and ſpleen, and diſtemper; and now he ſpeaketh againſt ſuch a man, as if the man and the ſin were one ſubſtance: the Miniſter cannot ſpeak againſt pride, gariſhneſs of apparel, long ſhagged hair; but he ſpeaketh againſt the man, as if the ſin were the man, and the man and the ſin all one: therefore take heed of being in a chafe when thy ſins are reproved; And know, that if thou thus do fret and chafe, it is not onely an Argument that thou art poſſeſſed with a ſpiritual pride, and a ſpiritual frenzy and madneſs; but it is a ſign of Gods heavy wrath and judgment ready to break out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſouls of thoſe men that ſo fret and chafe, and take on in impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; It is an immediate fore-runner of Gods heavy wrath, when men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide to be touched, or to have the word of God applied particularly, they are impatient of reproof, and muſt have the Preacher to ſpeak plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing things, and to daube them up with untempered morter; this bringeth upon them the hand of God unto remedileſs and eaſleſs Deſtruction, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay 30.13, 14. of ſaith the Prophet, this is a foul ſin, when men teach their Preachers what to ſay, it is like the breaking of a high wall; that is ſodain, or like a bump in a wall, a ſwelling knob, that upon a ſodain fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down to the ground, and is broken all to pieces like a Potters Veſſel, that is broken in ſhivers, and there is not ſo much left as to hold fire or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo it is with thoſe that repine at the particular application of the word, their deſtruction is ſudden. Again, further conſider we, if ſo be we be willing, and ready to hear the word of comfort applied unto us, though it belongeth not unto us, and we can accumulate the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and yet put away from us the word of reproof, we cannot endure that; ſurely the Lord will then puniſh us in the ſame kinde, he will deal with us proportionably, and accordingly, he will make his word of comfort (that we ſo eagerly take hold on) an unprofitable word, and a word that ſhall yield no comfort unto us, when we lie on our ſick beds and in the hour of death, becauſe we receive the word of comfort that appertaineth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and put away the word of reproof, therefore he will make the word of comfort comfortleſs. Conſider (to this purpoſe) the example of Herod, Mark 6.20. Herod heard, and did many things gladly that John Baptiſt taught, and found much comfort in hearing of him; but when John came to touch him, and to hit him on the bare, his beloved ſore, and pleaſing Dalilah, that it was unlawfull for him to have his Brothers Wife; then Herod ſhewed what he was, he carried then a ſplenative minde, and a grudge in his heart, and never left till he had his head: what, touch my beloved Sin? And the Lord dealt with Herod accordingly; for thoſe comforts that he appropriated to himſelf from Johns preaching were fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: he went on in his ſin, and periſhed fearfully in his folly. Then learn we to hear the word, not cunningly for our inſtruction and comfort, but in matter of exhortation and juſt reproof, to be taxed for our ſins. And when the Lord meeteth with us in his word, for our particular ſins, to ſay it is his Mercy and his bleſſing, and to thank God that we have Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters which do not daube us with untempered morter, and to ſay as David ſaith in Pſal. 141.5. let the righteous ſmite me, it is a pretious balm, this is the affection of the godly; but if we do accumulate to our ſelves the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that are promulgated in the Goſpel, and caſt away, the reproofs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:108302:68"/> againſt our ſins, God will then make his comforts comfortleſs, and they ſhall do us no good.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                     </label> is the cauſe and ground of mans election, or ſalvation. Neither any mans willing of good, or working of good, no not the willing, or working of good, by a regenerate perſon; by a perſon truly ſanctified, and in the eſtate of grace, not his willing, or working of good, that is the cauſe and ground of his election, or ſalvation. (And ſo to prevent an Objection in the beginning) For the Papiſts they ſay, (eluding the evidence of this text in this manner,) It is not in him that willeth, or runneth after the fleſh, and according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by your leave (ſay they) it is in him that willeth, and runneth by Faith, which is grounded upon Gods mercy, &amp; may agree with Gods mercy. A poor ſhift; and thus they ſeek to ſhift off the Evidence of this text, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt in this place. For the oppoſition here, is not between man willing, and running, after the fleſh; and mans willing and running by faith, they are not here oppoſed. But mark the oppoſition, it ſtandeth thus, Between mans willing, and running, and Gods ſhewing mercy, theſe are the things that be here oppoſed, and ſet in Contradiction, one to the other, mans willing, and running in a good way, and in the way of ſanctification, and ſalvation, and the Lords ſhewing of mercy; ſo that neither the willing of good, nor the working of good, by any, though a regenerate perſon, is the thing that is available to election, or ſalvation; As in 2 Tim. 1.9. The Apoſtle there denyeth, that either himſelf, or any other true believer, and regenerate perſon, that they were either called, or ſaved by their own works; for ſaith he, He hath called and ſaved us, Not according to our own works, but according to his own grace, whether they were works natural, or ſupernatural; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in Titus 3.4, 5. verſes, he ſaith, in the fourth verſe, <hi>when the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulneſſe and love of God appeareth:</hi> then in the fifth verſe he ſubjoyneth, <hi>not according to the works of righteouſneſſe which we have done, but of his own mere mercy he ſaved us:</hi> ſo that the willing or working of good, is not the cauſe of any mans election, or ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon is, Becauſe the goodneſſe which is in the will of man, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                     </label> and the goodneſſe which is in the works of man, it proceedeth from Gods election, it is an effect, and a fruit of it; It proceedeth from that root, and ſo is the fruit of holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe: as the Apoſtle ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, in Epheſ. 1.4. <hi>God hath choſen us in Chriſt, before the foundation of the world was laid, that we ſhould be holy:</hi> ſo that holineſſe followeth Gods eternal election. And therefore the willing, or working of good, by rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate perſons, cannot poſſibly be the cauſe of Gods eternal election, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the effect: for it is not poſſible that the ſame thing can be the cauſe of the ſame thing, and the effect in one and the ſelf-ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>For Application: Firſt of all this meeteth with that opinion which <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> ſome do hold, That it is of God, a man may be ſaved: But that men are ſaved; That particular perſons amongſt men come to be ſaved, that is of themſelves. This do ſome hold and affirm. And it is their tenent, That the poſſibility of the ſalvation of man, that it is poſſible for men to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that is of God. But that this poſſibility becometh profitable and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108302:69"/> to ſome men, that is, of their own free will. A foul and a groſſe errour, directly contrary to the truth now handled, and delivered unto us, if it be ſo, that the poſſibility of the ſalvation of man, becometh profitable, to ſome particular perſons amongſt men, from the freedom of their own will; ſurely then it muſt needs be from the goodneſſe of their own will, and from their well-willing. And then a believing ſoul, a ſoul that ſhall be ſaved, and now is in the ſtate of grace, and of ſalvation, hath ground to boaſt of in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; And may lift up himſelf, even againſt God himſelf in oſtentation, and may thus magnifie himſelf, &amp; ſay unto God, Lord that there was any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for me to be ſaved, it was of thee, I freely confeſs it, but that this poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility proveth not an impoſſibility to me, as it doth to many thouſands in the world, that was my own doing, I did that of my ſelf. That I could be ſaved, the thanks of that belongeth to thee Lord; but that I am now in the ſtate of grace and ſalvation: And that I am ſure to be ſaved, the thanks of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to me my ſelf. For thy love to me was no more, then to them that are damned, till my willingneſſe to receive grace, and faith, put a difference between me and them, till the inclination of my ſoul made me thine. I might for all thy love have been damned eternally; as well as Cain, Judas, Saul, or any other Reprobate, had not I out of the righteouſneſſe, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the freedom of my own will, choſen grace: it was not of thee, Lord, but of my ſelf, that I choſe grace: And damnation had been mine, had I not of my own free and voluntary will choſen and uſed grace: Oh beloved is not this intolerable, and monſtrous pride and ambition, thus in oſtentation, for a man to lift up himſelf againſt God? Is this a thought, to come into any Chriſtians heart, no, it is to be renounced: For this boaſting and oſtentation doth naturally follow upon this their tenent, that they teach, the poſſibility of ſalvation cometh from God, but that that poſſibility cometh into Act, is of mans free will: And this ought by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian to be abjured, renounced, and caſt away, as blaſphemous, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, and falſe.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Again, This being a truth, that no mans willing or doing of good, is the cauſe of election, or ſalvation; Then, let this teach us to take heed, that we ground not our ſalvation upon any thing willed or done by us, be it never ſo good; yea though it proceed from the root and radix of true ſanctifying grace. It is mere madneſſe in the Papiſts, enemies to Gods grace, to ground their hope of ſalvation (as they do) upon the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of thoſe good things that God requireth of them; ſo far forth as they are able to perform them; thus they ground their hope of ſalvation. Now they ſo grounding their hopes, they have no reaſon in the world to hope for any good at the hands of God: for who ſeeth not? (unleſſe he be wilfully blinded and blindfolded by his own ſelf-love, ſelf-will, and ſelf-conceit,) who ſeeth not, I ſay, how far ſhort we come of doing thoſe good things we ought to do, either in the ſtate of nature, or in the ſtate of grace. And the Papiſts themſelves, (to joyn with them) when they deal againſt that comfortable and holy truth of God, that is held and taught in our Church; That a Child of God may in time of this life, be infallibly aſſured of our own ſalvation; the Papiſts (when they deal againſt this holy and comfortable truth) then they plead, and ſay, alas, we are frail, and we are weak creatures, and we fail in the manner of doing good duties, and therefore we cannot aſſure our ſelves of ſalvation: What, ſay they, do you ſay, we may be aſſured of our ſalvation, upon our faith, and doing good duties? Alas, we are full of imbecillity and weakneſſe, and cannot have any aſſurance. (It is true indeed, if ſo be that our hope of ſalvation ſtood built upon the weak ground of our own good works.) But mark their ſubtilty, when they ſpeak againſt the Doctrine of our Church, they plead imbecillity and weakneſſe. But when they plead for their own Doctrine, then they ſay, they ground their hope of ſalvation upon the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:108302:69"/> performance of the good things God requireth of them, ſo far forth as they are able to perform them, what a madneſſe is this in them, thus to contradict themſelves? And beloved, (to apply it to our ſelves) are there not many amongſt us as mad as the Papiſts? fooliſh ignorant ſots, That thus reaſon, I know I muſt love God, above all, and my neighbour as my ſelf: And if I do my beſt endeavour to do theſe things, I hope God will be merciful unto me, and I ſhall go to heaven: what is this, but to make our own working of good, the ground of our ſalvation, and to ground the hope and certainty of heaven, upon their own well doing? Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is ſo ſimple, and ſo fooliſh, that upon loving God, and their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, they ſhall come to heaven, maketh that the ground of their ſalvation. It is true indeed, that the willing, and working of good, coming from a right radix, they be the fruits, and aſſurances of our ſalvation; but if we build our ſalvation upon our beſt good works: yea upon ſaving and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, or the beſt good thing we can perform, we delude and deceive our ſelves, neither our well willing, nor well working, is not the cauſe, or ground of our ſalvation. It is the rule of Chriſt himſelf, Luk. 17.10. when we have done all that we can do, and all that the Lord hath commanded us to do, if it were poſſible, yet we muſt ſay we are unprofitable ſervants. And we muſt ſay ſo, not onely for modeſty ſake, as the Papiſts do abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gloſſe upon that text; for modeſty and humilities ſake, (ſay they) we muſt ſay ſo: why beloved, the Lord Jeſus doth not teach us to lye; And to ſay that which is not true, for modeſty ſake; no, but he teacheth us to ſpeak the truth; for indeed it is ſo, that for all our well willing, and well doing, we are unprofitable ſervants; yet we muſt take heed that we do not hereupon caſt off all care, and endeavour of well doing, no, we are carefully, and conſcionably to do all that we can do, that is good. And know, that working of good, coming from the root of ſaving and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, it is profitable, and neceſſary to heaven: for it is the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten high way, to eternal life and ſalvation; it is a teſtimony of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and thankfulneſſe to God for his mercy. And it is a means to ſet forth the glory of God, and maketh much for the illuſtration of it. And it is a proper mark of a true Chriſtian, it is a fruit ever flowing from ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and juſtifying faith; and it is a neceſſary antecedent, of the promiſes of eternal glory in heaven: yet if we do advance this doing of good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this ſtrain, to merit ſalvation, we do built it upon a rotten, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound foundation.</p>
                  <p>Now further obſerve we, the Apoſtle maketh an oppoſition between mans willing and running, and Gods ſhewing mercy. Hence I might note theſe particulars:</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, that Gods mercy is the ſole, and whole, and al-ſufficient cauſe of mans election, and not mans well willing, or working good, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foreſeen, (as the Arminians teach,) or the preſent act and being.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, that Gods free grace, and the merit or works of men, do not concur and meet together, in mans ſalvation, as the Papiſts teach. But theſe things I have handled before. And hence note we in a word thus much. In that the Apoſtle ſaith, that the eternal election and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome amongſt men, is not in men themſelves, but in God that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercy. Hence obſerve,</p>
                  <p>That the eternal ſalvation of men is laid up in the merciful, powerful, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine: </seg>
                     </label> and gracious hand of God. It is laid up in the power of God, which is eſſential, with God himſelf, Col. 3.3. the Apoſtle telleth the Coloſſians, that their <hi>life is bid with Chriſt in God.</hi> And hence God is ſaid to be the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of glory,</hi> Epheſ. 1.17. becauſe glory is as it were begotten of him. And in 1 Tim. 6.5. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>he onely dwelleth in immortality.</hi> The Lord which hath eternal life and glory, he doth give it to whom he will, and he
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:108302:70"/> will give it in his due time, and therefore he will certainly give it to his choſen.</p>

                     </label> Then what a ground of ſweet and excellent comfort is this to every one that findeth himſelf to be in the number of Gods choſen? Haſt thou good evidence of it, that thou belongeſt to Gods election? Oh then conſider thy eternal happineſſe, which is laid up not in the hands of any creature: no, it is laid up in the hands of a gracious, and powerful God; and no enemy whatſoever can wreſt it out of his hands, if it were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thy own truſt, then thou haſt juſt cauſe to doubt, whether thou couldeſt keep it, or no: nay a thouſand to one, thou wouldeſt loſe it; Adam in his ſtate of innocency, being truſted with it, wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly loſt it, but thy ſalvation is kept by him, who is able to keep it, 2 Tim. 1.12. And not the force, fraud, or ſubtilty of the Devil, or world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, can fetch it from God, who is the Author of it, and keeper of it, no nor our own fleſh, can prevail to the overcoming of him: Oh then if thou haſt evidence of thy ſalvation, comfort up thy ſelf, let the Devil, and the world ſpit their malice, and uſe all the means they can, they cannot poſſibly deprive thee, or diſpoſſeſſe thee of it, for it is in the keeping of a powerful Creator, and they cannot take it out of his hand.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe two Verſes the Lord ſheweth by the Apoſtle, that he is juſt in caſting off ſome men, and rejecting of them. The Apoſtle having cleared God from the imputation of injuſtice, in chooſing ſome to life and ſalvation, and paſſing over others, out of his own free will, though they were all one in regard of nature: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath abſolute power, and free liberty, to ſhew compaſſion to whom he will. Now the Apoſtle cleareth God from being unjuſt, in rejecting of ſome particular perſons of equal eſtate and condition with the elect in regard of nature, every way equal unto them in themſelves. And the Apoſtle proveth the Lord not to be unjuſt in ſo doing, by a teſtimony of Scripture, fetching a particular example to that purpoſe, namely, the example of Pharaoh; <hi>(The Scripture ſaith to Pharaoh,)</hi> And thus our Apoſtle reaſoneth in this place, God dealt juſtly with Pharaoh, in with-holding his grace from him, in hardening his heart, thereby manifeſting his Reprobation; for God hardeneth none but Reprobates, and thereby manifeſting his rejecting: And why did the Lord deal juſtly, namely for the declaration of his own great power, and of his own great name, throughout the whole world. The Lords harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pharaoh, tended to this end, to ſhew, and to ſet forth the power of God, and to ſet forth the great name of the Lord throughout all the world: Pharaohs Reprobation tended to the glory of God, therefore it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt with God to reject any, and to leave them to their own wills: (his glory being dear unto himſelf.) This is the ſum and ſubſtance of this 17 verſe.</p>
               <p>Now the general things laid before us in this 17 verſe, they are two:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:108302:70"/> Firſt, a preface unto the teſtimony alledged by the Apoſtle, in theſe words, <hi>For the Scripture ſaith unto Pharaoh.</hi> Wherein we may conſider the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the teſtimony; a teſtimony written; the Scripture ſaith it. The ſecond general thing is the teſtimony it ſelf, the words of Scripture, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtle, <hi>That I might ſhew my power in thee, and my name might be declared thooughout all the world:</hi> In which conſider two things: Firſt, Gods act, his ſtirring, and raiſing up Pharaoh. And then the end of that act, which is the manifeſtation of Gods power in Pharaoh: And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the great and glorious name of God, throughout all the world. Come we now to the ſenſe and meaning of the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Scripture ſaith unto Pharaoh,]</hi> By <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is a general term, we are to underſtand the holy Scripture, the written Word of God, Gods ſpeaking in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>for this ſame purpoſe have I ſtirred thee up] raiſed,</hi> or <hi>appointed thee:</hi> for ſo it is diverſly tranſlated, being all one in ſenſe. Theſe words we find in Exod. 9.16. Now how the Lord ſtirred and raiſed up Pharaoh, there is the difficulty. And there be different and divers opinions touching the meaning of this phraſe and ſentence. Some do underſtand it, of Pharaohs raiſing up, and advancing to the Kingdom; For this cauſe have I raiſed thee up to the Kingdome. And this is the Annotation of the <hi>Remiſts,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this very text; but the Apoſtle hath a further reach then this: And ſome there be, that underſtand it of the keeping, and preſerving of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh alive in the midſt of the ten plagues of Egypt; that he might drown him into the bottom of the Sea: but this cannot be the meaning of the text, becauſe many other of the people beſides Pharaoh, was kept by God from thoſe plagues. Divers other opinions there be, touching this phraſe and form of ſpeech here uſed by the Apoſtle, I will not trouble you with the variety of them. But the beſt way to find out the right meaning of this place, is arightly to conſider that place, and the Circumſtances of it, in the ninth of Exodus, 13, 14, 15. verſes. God bids Moſes go unto Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, and to let his people go, that they might ſerve him; and withal he bids him ſay unto Pharaoh, that he would ſend upon him all his plagues, and all his puniſhments, even upon thy very heart and ſoul; upon thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, thy people, that thou mayeſt know there is no God like unto me, I will ſtretch out my hand, and ſmite thee with my peſtilence, and make thee to periſh even from the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>And in the ſeventeenth verſe of the ſame Chapter; Notwithſtanding, theſe threatnings of plagues brought againſt him, yet Pharaoh ſtill exalted himſelf againſt God and againſt his people, and he would not let them go. Now if we mark (between theſe two things) between the threatnings of theſe plagues, and the taxing of Pharaoh, for his exalting himſelf againſt God commeth in this ſentence in the 16. verſe. And indeed for this very cauſe have I ſtirred thee up; I have ſent Moſes and threatned my plagues againſt thee, and yet thou wilt not let my people go: Now theſe things being well conſidered; this comming between the menacing of judgement, and the taxing of his exalting againſt God: theſe two well compared yield unto us this ſignification for this cauſe, this very purpoſe have I withheld my grace from thee; and I have hardned thy heart as a fruit following thy rejection, and for this very cauſe have I caſt thee off, and made thee a flintie heart even for this very purpoſe have I cauſed thee to rebel againſt my threatning denounced by my ſervant Moſes, and have made it come to paſs, that thou ſhalt not proſper nor profit by my plagues and judgements; and this is the right ſence and meaning of the words. Now beloved, if any think it to harſh and hard to ſay that God doth ſtir up the wicked heart of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, to rebel againſt God and againſt Moſes ſent unto him; and that God made him not to profit by his plagues and judgements; Let that man that thinketh it too harſh to aſcribe this unto God, conſider, that God did not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:108302:71"/> infuſe, or put any ſinful motion to evil, into the heart of Pharaoh, but he onely inclined that heart of his to rebel, and that in his ſecret and juſt will, James 1.13. God tempteth no man unto evil, but in his ſecret and juſt Judgment, did incline the heart of Pharaoh: And withal conſider in the ſecond place, that the Lord did order that rebellious and trecherous will of Pharaoh; to what end he himſelf had appointed, the Lord did incline it to rebel to the glory of his own name, and to the ſetting forth of his power; ſo that this being conſidered, that the Lord inclined his heart, ſo as that his Deſtruction might be to the glory of his great name; and theſe things will not then be ſo harſh, or hard: for the Lord infuſed no evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but his heart being corrupt of himſelf, he did incline and order it and diſpoſe that wicked will of Pharaoh, unto the end to which God had appointed; namely, to his deſtruction, and Gods glory: as for example in Jer. 51.11. we read in that Text, that the Lord raiſed up the ſpirit of the Medes, againſt Babel; and it is a certain truth the King of the Medes ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that expedition, and in that action of his againſt the King of Babel; yet it was done in the vengeance of the Lord. And ſo this is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that I might ſhew my power in thy deſtruction, and the force of me and of my power might be expreſſed in thy deſtruction, both of thee, and of thine, in the bottom of the Sea: And that others alſo might ſee, and take notice of my power, Exod. 14.31. when the Egyptians were drowned in the Sea, then Iſrael ſaw the mighty power of God. It was made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent unto Iſrael.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.]</hi> That is, the praiſe and glory of my power, and my Juſtice, appearing in the deſtruction of thee ſo mighty a King, might be publiſhed, and might be ſpread abroad in every part and corner of the world, and might be every where ſpoken of in every part and corner of the world.</p>
               <p>So then thus conceive the meaning of the Apoſtle in theſe words, as if he had ſaid;</p>
               <p>For God ſaid in his written Word, in his holy Scripture unto Pharaoh, Exodus 9.16. For this very cauſe, for this very purpoſe, have I with-held my grace and hardned thy heart; (a fruit following the rejection of thee:) and I have ſtirred up my meſſengers to come to deliver my judgements unto thee, and have cauſed thee not to profit by my judgements and my meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, and I have cauſed thee to harden thy heart and to exalt thy ſelfe againſt me, that I might make thee to ſee and feel the force of my hand, and of all my power in the bottome of the Sea; and that all other my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and all in the world may ſee and take notice of thy deſtruction, and my power, in deſtroying ſo mighty a king.</p>
               <p>Come we now to matter of Obſervation and Doctrine; and firſt of all obſerve the Apoſtle, here he ſpeaketh and alledgeth Scripture (as he had done heretofore, and as he doth frequently and often in this Chapter) to ground the matter that he hath in hand upon the Scriptures, hence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this concluſion.</p>

It is a ſufficient rule and ground to guide us in all things, and all matters, both of Faith and of good life, the holy Scriptures they doe contain in them all things needful to be known, to be believed, and to be practiſed of us to life and ſalvation; to this purpoſe is that in 2 Tim. 3.16, 17. where the Apoſtle Paul ſaith to Timothy, <hi>Thou haſt known the holy Scriptures of a childe, which are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation, through the faith of Ieſus Chriſt; For the whole Scripture is given by inſpiration, and is profitable to teach, to improve, to correct in righteouſneſs, and to make the man of God abſolute and perfect in every good work;</hi> it is able to make a man intire in godlineſs, I know the Cavil of the Papiſts againſt this clear evidence of Scripture (for they ſeek to illude the evidence of this Text in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:108302:71"/> this maner. It is true indeed (ſay they) the Apoſtle ſaith, the Scripture is profitable, but where doe you finde he ſaith it is ſufficient? A meer ſhift, and eaſily anſwered; for the Apoſtle ſaith not barely, that the Scripture is profitable (and there ſtay himſelf and goe no further) but he doth point out unto us to what uſe it ſerveth, it is profitable; and it is profitable to to teach, to inſtruct, and to improve, and to make a man abſolute and intire in every good work: Is it not then ſufficient? (a fooliſh cavill) ſo in the 15 verſe of the ſame Chapter, ſaith the Apoſtle, the Scripture is able to make a man wiſe unto ſalvation; Is not the Scripture then ſufficient? it is able to bring a man unto Heaven, and yet (ſay the Papiſts) it is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, certainly it cannot be denied, but that the whole Scripture containeth all things, needful to life and ſalvation, and to make a man to come to Heaven, would any man deſire more ſufficiencie then this? the reaſon is. <label type="milestone">

               <p>Becauſe the written Word of God, it is the breath of the holy ſpirit of God, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, it is given by inſpiration; from whom? from the Devil? No, from the holy Spirit of God, the holy Ghoſt; And in the Scripture, Gods will is made known unto his choſen; and as I have often ſaid, Gods Word is his Epiſtle and love-letter ſent unto his children to guide them in the way of life, and ſalvation, Pſalm 119.105. It is a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn to their feet, and a light unto their paths, to guide them in every ſtep they tread as a lanthorn and light doth guide a man in dark and obſcure places; ſo doth Gods Word guide them in the way of life and ſalvation: And hath God beſtowed upon his Church and choſen a guide inſufficient, that is not able to lead them to Life and ſalvation, but to ſuffer them to wander into by paths of errors and ſinnes? no, it is blaſphemous ſo to think; for the holy Scripture doth contain all things needful to be known and practiſed both for life and manners.</p>

                  <p>IN that the Apoſtle ſaith, for the Scripture ſaith unto Pharaoh, we ſee here a ſtrong confirmation of that which we noted out of the 15. verſe, That the written Word of God is a ſpeaking Word: And God ſpeaketh to his Church and people by his written Word; and therefore the Scripture is not a dead letter, or dumb Judge, and ſenceleſs Juke as the Papiſts ſay, (but paſſe by that) Onely note the Apoſtle ſaith, the Scripture ſpeaketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Pharaoh, it ſpeaketh touching the reprobation of Pharaoh, and

And we may hence take notice of it,<note place="margin">The Doctrine of Reprobation a Doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the written Word.</note> that the Doctrine of Reprobation, is a Doctrine made known unto us in the Scripture, and in the written Word of God; yea the Doctrine of the Reprobation of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons amongſt men, it may, and it ought to be publiſhed in the Church of God; It is a part of the holy Word of God, and a portion of Scipture written and revealed in the Word: And we ought to take notice of it, as Moſes ſaith in Deut. 29.29. Things revealed belong to us and to our children, ſecret things belong to God; ſo that the Doctrine of Reprobation and caſting off of ſome particular perſons amongſt men, ought to be taught to the Church and Children of God. Some there be that are of opinion, that the Doctrine of Reprobation ought to be concealed and not to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and made known to the Church and people of God; And why? becauſe of the danger of it ſay they; for as they conceive and imagine, it driveth ſome men from God, and it maketh ſome men to run into deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; therefore ſay they, it is to be concealed, and not made known to the Church of God: But theſe that thus think, they are deceived. For the Alienation and the eſtranging of mens mind from God, and deſperation, are not the fruits properly following the Doctrine of Reprobation, they do not proceed and come from, and by that Doctrine properly, but they are accidental effects commonly following it, and are curſed fruits comming from the hearts of men, and ſo the fault is in themſelves and not in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Reprobation, the Doctrine it ſelf, is holy, good and profitable, if men doe rightly underſtand it, and ſavour it aright, it is of excellent uſe, and very neceſſarie; For the beſt Doctrine that is, the moſt comfortable Doctrine that is, may be perverted and abuſed ſometimes and become ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of ſome to their utter deſtruction; as the Doctrine of ſaving faith in Chriſt Jeſus and his merits is ſavoured of ſome to their utter deſtruction, and therefore ought it not to be publiſhed? It is a weak inſufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to prove that the Doctrine of Reprobation ought not to be made known becauſe of theſe accidental effects; becauſe ſome through their own corruption are cauſed to run into Alienation from God, and Deſperation; whereas the Doctrine of Reprobation is of neceſſary uſe; it ſerveth much to commend and ſet forth the mercies of God, and the riches of his mercy to his choſen children.</p>
                  <p>And it ſtirreth up the Children of God to a great meaſure of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for the mercies of God beſtowed upon them, when they conſider that <hi>God</hi> hath choſen them, and refuſed and rejected others; this ſtirreth them up to magnifie the mercie of God; and then doth the ſoul of a child of <hi>God</hi> melt within him for joy. When he conſidereth the infinite love of God unto him in his election, it maketh his heart to break within him, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he conſidereth it together with the rejection of others compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, that he poyſeth his ſalvation was ſo dear and precious to the Lord, that the Lord preferred him before many thouſands in the world, equal to him and every way comparable, and in his ſaving mercy, vouchſafed to chooſe him to life and ſalvation, and rejected others. Oh this maketh the heart of a childe of God to break within him for joy: Oh the comfort of this Doctrine is wonderful great to conſider it arightly, it ſtirreth up a child of God by all means poſſible to magnifie the great and unſpeakable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and therefore the Doctrine of Reprobation, is not to be kept ſecret, but ought to be taught and publiſhed.</p>

                     </label> That God hardeneth Reprobates; and none but reprobates are harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God: As ſaving faith is proper to Gods elect, and therefore called the faith of Gods elect, in Titus 1.1. So Gods blinding and hardening are things proper, and peculiar to the Reprobate; and whomſoever God doth blind and harden, by the malice of the devil, out of all queſtion thoſe perſons are in the ſtate of Reprobation. I meddle not now with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Gods hardening, for that belongeth to the next verſe: but onely I point out the ſubjects of Gods blinding, and hardening; and I ſay they onely are Reprobates, and none but Reprobates are hardened of God. And hence it is that we find in Scripture, that it is ſaid, that God departed from, and forſook ſome particular perſons, being Reprobates. Indeed the Lord doth many times withdraw himſelf from his Choſen, withdraw the light of his countenance from his beſt children, but he doth never depart from them altogether, never forſake them utterly. Now we read in Scripture of ſome that God departed from finally; in the 1 Sam. 18.12. it is ſaid, that the Lord departed from Saul, and not onely forſook him, but ſent an evil ſpirit, a Devil, to torment him, and gave him up to be tormented of his own vile luſts: to anger and fear, to envy and hatred, to envy David. And thus alſo we find God gave up the reprobate heathen, unto their own hearts luſts, in Rom. 1.21. God gave them up to their very hearts luſts: and in the 26. verſe, he gave them up to vile affections: and in the 28 verſe he goeth a ſtep farther, he gave them up reprobate to minds, to do things not comely. And in the 2 Theſſ. 2.10. the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, that thoſe perſons whom Satan (by Antichriſt) ſhall ſeduce, and draw into errours, by his lying wonders, and ſignes, (who are they?) ſuch as periſh, whoſe come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaith the Apoſtle, it is with the working of Satan, and in all power of ſignes, and lying wonders, and in all powers of the Devil, and ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, whom? thoſe that periſh; thoſe that ſhall be damned, thoſe that ſhall be ſtrongly deluded, and drawn into the errour of Papiſme. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I will not affirm all Papiſts ſhall periſh, I doubt not but God hath ſome of his choſen in Rome, in Babylon, in the chief ſeat of Antichriſt; as it is ſaid in Revel. 18.4. Come out of Babylon my people, you that are there come out: ſo that I will not ſay, all that are ſeduced ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the living and vital members of Antichriſt, ſuch as are relieved by him whom God hath given to be ſeduced, and to be the peculiar limbs and members of the Devil, and of Antichriſt, ſuch as they are ſhall periſh, and utterly be deſtroyed, in the 2 Corinth. 4.3, 4. <hi>If the Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that periſh,</hi> to them that ſhall go into hell and be damned, whom the god of this world, the devil, hath blinded their eyes, that they ſhould not ſee the glorious Goſpel undoubtedly; ſhewing, that ſuch that are blinded by Satan, and are hardened by God, and are given over to a Reprobate ſenſe, they are ſuch that ſhall periſh and be damned.</p>

                  <p>And (take notice of it) the Lord doth not now in this latter age of the world, ſtand over men with his Judgments, and whips, and his ſword of vengeance in temporal plagues and puniſhments, but rather in ſpiritual plagues and Judgments upon the ſoules of men, in hardneſſe of heart, and blindneſſe of mind; and the nearer the general day of Judgment is at hand, wherein the Lord will render to every man, according to his works, the more the Lord doth ſurceaſe from temporal Judgments and plagues, and lets them go on, filling the number of their ſins, and then he layeth load upon them; ſo that the nearer the day cometh, the more the Lord ſurceaſeth temporal puniſhments, and puniſheth with blindneſſe of mind, and hardneſſe of heart: and therefore let none think that they are well, and in good caſe, as many do, becauſe they are free from temporal plagues and puniſhments, nor ſick, nor moleſted with theſe and theſe troubles, and yet in their ſoules they lye under the heavy hand of God, in blindneſſe and hardneſſe, in ignorance and obſtinacy; for herein God hath begun to execute his Judgments already: God now ſitteth in Judgment upon him, his heavy hand of wrath and vengeance is now over him, and doth now point and mark him out for a caſt-away, and ſeal up unto him his own everlaſting damnation, the fearfulleſt and miſerableſt eſtate and condition that can befall a man.</p>

                  <p>And come we now to the next thing, for this ſame end (ſaith the Lord unto Pharaoh) have I ſtirred thee up; you may remember I ſhewed you, that theſe words do carry this ſenſe; For this ſame purpoſe, Pharaoh, have I withheld my grace, hardened thy heart, left thee to thy ſelf, ſo that ſtill thou doſt exalt thy ſelf againſt my people, and doſt keep them in bondage, and wilt not let them go; I have ſtirred thee up, hardened thy heart, and cauſed thee to rebel againſt me and my people.</p>

Then the ſerious conſideration of this, may be a ground of ſweet and excellent comfort to the members of the Church in particular, and to the whole Church in general, when they are vexed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious indignities of wicked Oppoſers, when the Church and people of God are hardly dealt withall by the hands of wicked perſecutours, remember this to their comfort, howſoever their enemies doe execute their crueltie to ſatisfie their own luſts, yet herein they are but executors of the purpoſe, and will of God, they doe but act the purpoſe of God, and what the Lord hath commanded, they are but the rodde in the hand of the Lord to be dealt withall, as God pleaſeth, and not to doe as they liſt, for if it were ſo, they would utterly root them out; but when the wicked enemies of the Church of God doe their uttermoſt and wicked rage, then they are but inſtruments uſed by the hand of the Lord, for the executing of his will, and appointment, and when the Lord hath ſo done he will eaſe himſelf, and his children of them, and they cannot go beyond the will and the appointment of the Lord, though they be raging mad in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting of their crueltie, when they come to the full point and period, they muſt not, nor cannot go any further, he hath ſtirred them up by his will and eternal Counſel; and he can keep them within the limmits and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of his own will, and what he hath appointed them to doe that they ſhall doe, and no more; though they would burſt in ſunder; in Eſay, 10.24.25. the Lord ſweetly ſpeaketh to this purpoſe, having before given the Aſſyrians charge to deſtroy, then in the 24. verſe, he ſaith, <hi>(Oh my People, be not afraid of Aſhur, for all this, for he ſhall but ſmite thee with the rod, and lift up his ſtaffe after the manner of Aegypt, and for a very little ſmall time, but he ſhall be conſumed in my anger, and deſtroyed in my wrath; howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may ſcourge thee for a time, yet in my anger ſhall he be deſtroyed.</hi> Thus the wicked enemies of the Church of God, doe thus execute their wrath upon the Church of God, yet they can goe no further then God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and when they have done Gods Will, then he will caſt the rod into the fire, 1 Pet. 4.17. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Though afflictions begin at the the Houſe of God, certainly it ſhall not rest nor abide there;</hi> but from thence it ſhalbe removed unto the enemies of the Church, and then the Lord doth vouchſafe eaſe and comfort, and delivery to his people; then from the rage of enemies, then doth God bring plagues and troubles, and vexations, upon the heads of the enemies of the Church, Proverbs 11.8. <hi>The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eſcapeth out of trouble, and the wicked cometh even in the place;</hi> they change places one with the other, the righteous are taken out of the ſtocks, and they are put in the priſon with the wrath and vengeance of the Lord; yet let us know to our comfort, when the rage and violence of the enemie is come to the full height, then is the ruine of the enemy near at hand, and come to the full, and deliverance near to the Church of God. See it in the eſtate of the people of God in Aegypt, when Pharaoh dealt with moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, againſt them, and was in the greateſt rage, in Exodus 3 7, 8. ſaith the Lord, <hi>I have ſeen the trouble and oppreſſion of my people, and now I will help them:</hi> So that if ſo be the Lord ſhould ſuffer the bloudy minded Papiſts, that are our mercileſſe and cruel enemies; if he ſhould ſuffer them to over top us, and to have a hand over us, (which God prevent) but if that they ſhould deale hardly with us, then take notice of it to our comfort, they neither can nor ſhall doe any thing but what God will have them to doe; no not a haires breadth in the exerciſe of their crueltie, for when their rage is moſt violent, and they moſt mad, then is their utter deſtruction near, then Antichriſt falleth finally, and then is our deliverance near at hand.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:108302:76"/> And therefore let this be thought upon to our comfort, it will be a means to ſtrengthen us againſt all diſcouragement though they be fierce and cruel againſt us; for when they are in their pride then deſtruction cometh to them, and eaſe and delivery to us.</p>

And if I find it will not tend to the glory of my God, though it tend to the ſalvation of my ſoul, I dare not do it: and hereby we ſhall have good evidence that we love God, and are truly beloved of God; for if we honour God, God will honour us, in the 1 Sam. 2.30. <hi>they that honour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be deſpiſed:</hi> Yea the Lord will not onely honour us here, but give us ſalvation; he will give us honour and glory in the hearts of thoſe that hate us, and force the wicked, that do hate and condemn us with their mouthes, when they ſmite us with their tongues, to honour us in their hearts: and we ſhall not onely be honoured of him here, but when we ceaſe to be, Prov. 10.7. <hi>the memorial of the juſt is bleſſed; but the name of the wicked ſhall rot:</hi> when the body of the righteous is raked up in the duſt, then ſhall his name be ſweet, and he eternally bleſſed.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow come we to the 18. Verſe, <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.</hi> This Verſe, beloved, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the whole matter, handled by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the three verſes foregoing. In the 15, 16, and 17. Verſes our Apoſtle having made it clear, that God hath abſolute power, and free liberty, of ſhewing mercy to ſome, by the ſpeech of God unto Moſes, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.</hi> And having made it manifeſt, that God hath the like abſolute power and free liberty in paſſing by ſome others, and rejecting them, to the glory of his own name; and proving that by the example of Pharaoh, whom God hardened, as a manifeſt ſign of his reprobation: the Apoſtle having thus proved both theſe parts, upon this premiſes, the Apoſtle in this verſe bringeth in this Concluſion, that God hath free liberty, and abſolute power, to ſhew mercy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will; and this is the relation of this verſe to the foregoing matter.</p>
               <p>Now in this verſe obſerve we a double act of God; the one is, Gods ſhewing of mercy unto ſome; and the other, Gods hardening of ſome others: and then from whence this double act of God proceedeth, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the mere good will and pleaſure of God; ſo that the double act of mercy, and hardening, proceedeth from one ground: Gods good will. Now a little to lay open the meaning of the words.</p>
               <p>Touching the phraſe, and form of ſpeech, that God hath mercy, we had the ſame phraſe in the 15. verſe; where I ſhewed you, what we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by mercy, namely, not the properties of mercy which is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in God, but the Act, the exerciſe and work of Gods mercy: God hath mercy upon ſome; the act, the exerciſe, and the works of God is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and reached out unto ſome particular perſons, unto them to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will, and on whomſoever he pleaſeth, merely out of his own free will, and abſolute good pleaſure; (and whom he will he hardeneth,) that is, whomſoever pleaſeth him out of the ſame free and abſolute will he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth: and the word <hi>harden,</hi> here, is put in oppoſition to Gods ſhewing of mercy, before ſpoken of; for theſe two are oppoſed, God hath mercy, and he hardeneth: ſo then the meaning of it is, whereas before is meant, the ſhewing and extending of Gods mercy to ſome; ſo here by harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is meant, that God doth harden and withhold his mercy from ſome, and in his juſt Judgment doth leave them to themſelves, and to their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hardneſſe; for hardening muſt be underſtood, as a Judiciary act, and act of Gods Juſtice, whereby God doth inflict Judgment upon men, as a manifeſtation of their reprobation, and rejection, called a Judiciary act: So then briefly conceive we the meaning of the Apoſtle; as if he had ſaid:</p>
               <p>Therefore God doth extend and reach out the act, the exerciſe, and the work of his mercy, and of his grace, unto whomſoever it pleaſeth him, even meerly out of his own free and abſolute will, and out of his own good pleaſure, and alſo out of the ſame meer free will and abſolute good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the ſame God doth deny his ſaving mercy, and withhold his grace and mercy from ſome, and leave them in his juſt judgement in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hardneſſe, as a manifeſt ſign of their reprobation; ſo thus God hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardenneth.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:108302:78"/>
               <p>Come we now to matter of Obſervation and Doctrine: And firſt of all, from the firſt act of God, that God hath mercy on whom he will, the words being underſtood of the extending and reaching out of Gods mercy; Here again the ſame point is offered unto us, which before we handled in the 15. verſe, namely.</p>

                  </label> That Gods mercy reached out and extended to his choſen, is moſt free and voluntary, it dependeth upon the free will of God, and upon nothing elſe; it dependeth upon nothing out of God but upon his meer love: yet this point is not to be paſſed over without ſome further uſe and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, then heretofore was made.</p>

                  </label> And for the Application of it, we are to conſider it as a guide, and rule unto us in our ſhewing of mercy to our brethren, in our reaching and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending of mercy here is a rule and guide to direct us. Doth God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and reach out his mercy to his choſen, freely, and voluntarily, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moving him but his own free will, and good love? ſurely then we muſt thus do, we muſt be merciful, as our heavenly Father is merciful, Luke 6.36. Now how is he merciful? freely, out of his own free love, and mere goodneſſe, nothing moving him thereunto, but his own free love: thus muſt we do, we muſt ſhew mercy, and exerciſe the works of mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our brethren freely, not reſpecting their merits, nor their deſervings; yea beloved, our mercy and doing of good, and the comfort we adminiſter and yeeld to any either in word, or in deed, muſt proceed from the inward movings of our hearts, and the yearning and tenderneſſe of our bowels, towards thoſe to whom we do any good, out of pity, and compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, even as God doth freely, nothing moving us thereunto, in Eſay 5.10. the Prophet ſaith, <hi>if thou pour out thy ſoul to the hungry;</hi> mark this you that are faſt fiſted: the Lord doth not onely require the pouring out of food, but of our very hearts and ſoules, to feed the poor with the Affections of thy heart. And indeed it is not an act of mercy pleaſing to God, that the Lord delighteth in, that cometh either from our abundance, and ſuperfluity, or elſe the importunity of thoſe that are in great want, and need, nor yet from the example of others, inviting us thereunto, or for the deſire of praiſe, and ſeeking of Commendations amongſt men, that we would be well thought on; no, theſe are not works of mercy pleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, nor yet a work of mercy that is forced from men, by ſome tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and torment, to ſtop the mouth of an accuſing, and guilty conſcience: as for example, when wicked rich men, that are guilty to themſelves, how they have gotten their goods by evil meanes, and have hoarded up abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of wealth by the damnable ſin of Uſury, by griping, and oppreſſing the poor, and ſuch unlawful means. And when they lye upon their death-bed, gaſping for breath, then they are forced to beſtow ſomething to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious uſes, they give nothing before they dye; but when they lye upon their death-bed, and their Conſciences flye up in their faces, then they will give to an Hoſpital, or an Almes-houſe, or to the poor, or Church, to ſtop the mouth of the Conſcience. But this is no better then Sauls ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, of which we read, in 1 Sam. 15. when he had tranſgreſſed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, in reſerving the beſt ſheep and oxen, he thought he would ſtop the mouth of the Lord with a Sacrifice: ſo when men have gotten their goods by oppreſſion and uſury, then when they are upon their death-beds, then they will give unto the poor. But the ſhewing of mercy that is pleaſing unto God, muſt come out of a tender and free heart: as God is free in mercy, ſo we muſt be free in exerciſing the works of mercy: the works of mercy muſt come from the tenderneſſe of our hearts; and without that ſurely all our ſhewing of mercy, and doing of good, though we build Hoſpitals, as it is, 1 Cor. 13.3. <hi>If I feed the poor with all my goods, it is nothing, without the heart:</hi> the Lord looketh rather at the inward affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the heart, then the outward actions and duties of love and mercy,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:108302:78"/> 2 Cor. 9.7. every one as he is able muſt give, not grudgingly, becauſe he is compelled to do it, but the Lord loveth a cheerful giver. And conſider what moved the Lord to have mercy upon me, or upon thee, or upon any? nothing: ſo muſt we have mercy upon others, freely, and out of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of our bowels, pitying and commiſerating their eſtate, then thou art like unto God, and this will yeeld thee true comfort; elſe thy ſhewing of mercy is no better then Sauls ſacrifice, 1 Sam. 13.</p>
               <p>Again, in that the Apoſtle faith, God will have mercy upon whom he will, The Apoſtle ſheweth plainly, that Gods ſhewing of mercy is indeed limited and reached out unto ſome, and not unto others, even to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it pleaſeth him, he hath mercy upon whom he will, and not upon all; the Apoſtles ſpeech implyeth a limitation: the point hence lyeth plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Gods will it is, to extend and reach out his ſaving mercy, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                  </label> not to all men generally without exception of any, but onely unto ſome amongſt men. The Lord out of his own free will, and good pleaſure, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and reach out his ſaving mercy in the act, and exerciſe of it, onely unto ſome amongſt men, and not to all men generally, without exception. And this may appear to be a truth, by conſidering the ſaving mercies of God, the mercies of God that are extended and reached out from the hand of God to men: As firſt of all, the ſaving mercy of Election unto life and glory, it is according to the good will and pleaſure of God extended and reached out, onely unto ſome: the Text is clear, Epheſians 1.4, 5. where the Apoſtle ſaith, God hath choſen us (not all the world) but us, in in Chriſt, and hath Elected and Adopted us through Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; how? according to the good pleaſure of his will; ſo alſo the ſaving mercy of God touching effectual Vocation, and Calling, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good will and pleaſure of God extended to ſome amongſt men, in Matth. 11.25. <hi>I thank thee.</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>O Father, God of heaven and earth;</hi> I thank thee that thou haſt hid theſe things; what things? the ſaving comforts of the Goſpel, to be called to know thee through me; <hi>thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe, and revealed them unto babes;</hi> thou haſt hid them from ſome, and revealed them unto others: and he ſubjoyneth, <hi>even ſo it is O Father, becauſe it ſo pleaſeth thee:</hi> and in 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>God hath called in by an holy calling, according to his purpoſe and grace.</hi> Rom. 3.24. we are Juſtified freely, by the free grace of God, without reſpect had to any thing in us; thus the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh in James 1.18. of Sanctification, out of his own free will we are begotten, and ſanctified, and renewed. And touching Glorification, the conſummation of all, Rom. 6.24. it is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial gift of God beſtowed upon ſome, and not upon all, according to the will of Chriſt, Joh. 17.24. <hi>Father,</hi> (ſaith the Lord Jeſus,) <hi>I will that thoſe whom thou haſt given me, be where I am, and behold my glory;</hi> and be everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing partakers of my glory: ſo then we ſee that the ſaving mercies of God, from the beginning to the conſummation, they are reached out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good will and pleaſure of God.</p>
               <p>Hence it followeth, in the firſt place; that they erre groſly, who do hold <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> and affirm, that God hath elected all men to life, and ſalvation, if they will; and that God would have all men to be ſaved, and to come to life and ſalvation if they will, and (that men are not ſaved) that cometh to paſſe, becauſe men themſelves will not. This was the opinion of the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and now of the Papiſts in part, Anabaptiſts and Arminians, and others; Now this opinion is not onely erroneous and falſe in the ground, making the abſolute and unchangeable will of <hi>God,</hi> to depend upon the will of man, that if man will be ſaved <hi>God</hi> hath choſen him; but alſo this opinion of theirs cannot ſtand with the truth now delivered, that God giveth his ſaving mercy to whom he will. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> To this I anſwer, it is true indeed, <hi>God</hi> hath ſhut up all men in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all: what? all without exception of any? upon every man without exception? no, but upon all that believe, upon all the faithful ones among the Jewes and Gentiles; of whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh in this 11. Chapter, of whom he ſpeaketh, of the eſtate of the Jewes and Gentiles: I but (ſay they) this is a falſe interpretation; mark then, and to this purpoſe read, a paralel place unto this, in Gal. 3.22. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Scripture hath concluded and ſhut up all under ſin, that the promiſe of God;</hi> what promiſe? the promiſe of mercy, and faith in Chriſt Jeſus, might be extended and reached out; (what to all without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception?) no, ſaith the Apoſtle, unto them that believe; ſo the Apoſtle doth there limit the univerſal particle <hi>(all)</hi> to all believers, and ſo the place is to be taken.</p>
               <p>Again, for the place in Timothy, that God will have all men to be ſaved. Firſt, to anſwer to it; the word <hi>all,</hi> in that place, is not taken <hi>Collective,</hi> but <hi>Diſtributive,</hi> as they ſpeak; not collective, and gathering all men in the world; but diſtributive, by way of Diſtribution, ſome of all ſorts, of all ſtates, conditions, and degrees, and calling in the world: and that this is a truth, mark what the Apoſtle ſaith in the firſt verſe of this Chapter; <hi>I do exhort that prayers and ſupplications be made for all men;</hi> what ſhall we underſtand all mankind? no, he ſubjoyneth by way of diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, for all men in all callings, and conditions; for Kings, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, he ranketh them into their ſeveral degrees: ſo when God ſaith, <hi>I will have mercy upon all,</hi> his meaning is not all men ſhall be ſaved; but ſome of all ſorts: and again, as One ſaith, God will have all men, <hi>ſalvos fieri,</hi> to be ſaved, but God will not <hi>ſalvos facere,</hi> make all men to be ſaved, but he reacheth out his mercy to ſome of all ſorts.</p>

                  <p>This point beloved I often have had occaſion to note for the holy Ghoſt in this Chapter often offereth it unto us: And I ſtill note it againſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians; and the Anabaptiſts those peſtilentious ſpirits who hold and affirm that God doth then onely actually reject men (for they make a double rejection, purpoſe and act) and they ſay God doth then actually reiect men, when men reject Chriſt, and refuſe the Goſpel, then ſay they God rejecteth men; yea ſay the Anabaptiſts, the Apoſtle in this Chapter bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his face againſt thoſe Jewes that were zealous of the Law of God, and rejected Chriſt that ſought righteouſneſſe in the works of the Law, then God rejected, them, when they rejected Chriſt, and ſought ſalvation by the Law againſt thoſe (ſay they) the Apoſtle bendeth his face, and beateth.

                     </label> That Gods will is to harden ſome amongſt the ſonnes of men; The Lord is pleaſed to deny his ſaving grace and mercy, and to with hold it from ſome amongſt men, the places before alledged, (ſhewing that God out of his meer pleaſure reached out his ſaving mercy, not unto all, but onely to ſome; that very point doth evidence the truth of this point, that God doth with hold ſaving grace and ſaving mercy from ſome amongſt men, and doth harden them, but this may be further proved more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly; We finde in the Book of Exodus it is often ſaid, that <hi>the Lord did harden the heart of Pharaoh,</hi> as in the 7. chapter and 3. verſe, ſaith God, <hi>I will harden Pharaohs heart,</hi> and in the 9. chapter and 12 verſe, and alſo in the 10. chapter and the 20. verſe, <hi>The Lord hardned Pharaohs heart,</hi> and ſo in divers places; and alſo in Deuteronomy 2.30, Moſes telleth the people of God, <hi>that the Lord their God hardened the heart of the King of Moab, that he ſhould not give paſſage to the people of Iſrael; God</hi> made him an obſtinate heart; and in Joſhuah 11.20. Joſhuah ſpeaketh thus, <hi>That it came of the Lord, to harden the hearts of the wicked enemies of the Church of God;</hi> and in Pſalm 81.12. the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>That the people yielded not unto God, for he hardened their hearts;</hi> this may ſufficiently evidence unto us, that Gods will is to harden ſome amongſt men, and he is pleaſed to deny his ſaving mercy unto them.</p>

                     <note place="margin">How God har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth the heart.</note>But happily here, ſome not ſo well conceiving this point, how God is ſaid to harden men, it being difficult to their capacitie, may deſire to be further enformed touching this point. And therefore for their ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, know beloved, that God is ſaid to harden ſome men, not by infuſing, or putting of hardneſſe in their hearts, or making ſome mens hearts hard, that were ſoft, (as the Papiſts falſly charge us to affirm, no, nor yet by a bare permiſſion, by a bare permitting and ſuffering men ſo to be, as if the Lord were but a Spectator, and a looker on in the hardening of their hearts and had no hand in it, this is the dream and opinion of the Papiſts; but it is neither of theſe wayes, neither by infuſing hardneſſe, nor by a bare permiſſion: But ſurely God hardeneth ſome amongſt men two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by a ſpiritual diſertion by forſaking of men, and not vouchſafing his ſoftning grace unto them; ſo that it is truely ſaid, <hi>indurit quos, non emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit,</hi> he hardeneth whom he ſoftneth not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by puniſhing men for their former ſinnes by greater ſinnes, by puniſhing their former hardneſſe, by a further hardneſſe, adding one hardneſſe to another; for it is a juſt thing with God to inflict ſinne for ſinne. And God doth this, either by leaving men to the power of the Devil, as Gods executioner and tormenter, or the Lord leaveth them over to the luſts of their own hearts, and to their own corruptions, and ſo the point is thus to be conceived; That Gods will is to harden ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſonnes of men, by forſaking of them, and not vouchſafing his ſoftning grace, and that by ſpiritual diſertion, and as a juſt Judge, either giving them over to the power of the Devil, to be wrought upon by him as Gods executioner, or giving them over to the luſts of their owne hearts.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> ſome amongſt men, this in the firſt place may keep us from wondering, and thinking it ſtrange, that when the meanes of grace, the means that ſerve to work grace in the ſoules of men, to mollifie and ſoften the hearts of men, are vouchſafed, and yet all are not ſoftened, but ſome continue in their hardneſſe; (living under the means of ſoftening,) becauſe the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful meanes of grace are uneffectual, unleſſe it pleaſe God to put life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and to give efficacy by the work of his grace. Now the Lord is pleaſed ſometimes to withhold his ſaving and ſoftening grace from men, and to inflict hardneſſe upon them as a Judgment; and then no marvel it is, that they continue in their hardneſſe and ſins, and ſtiffe-neckedneſſe: And beloved, upon this ground, the Preachers and Miniſters of the Word may ſtay themſelves; when they ſee that after their labour and pains ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the ſoules of men, they ſee little or no fruit of their labour, he ſeeth that the profit of the ſame Word, delivered by him to one and the ſame people, is ſo divers and different, that ſome are bettered by it; and yeeld obedience to it, and do according to it, and ſome do clean contrary unto it; it is a ſavour of life unto ſome, and a ſavour of death unto others: thus it was in Exod. 9.20, 21. with the preaching of Moſes, thoſe whom God gave grace unto, yeelded; others yeelded not. The Lord is pleaſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to withhold his ſoftening grace from men, and to leave them to themſelves. And (beloved) the Lord commonly dealeth thus with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and ſuch as come unto the means of grace, onely out of form, and of faſhion, and of cuſtome, and are aſleep when they come unto it, they come without any longing deſire to profit by the means; they have no more deſire to profit by it, then the ſeats they ſit upon: then when they ſo come without a deſire to profit, and onely for form and faſhion, then the Lord ſuffereth them to go on in blindneſſe of mind, and hardneſſe of heart, that though they hear a hundred Sermons, yet they are dull and dead; and have no more good by them, then the ſeats in the Church. And hereby the Miniſter may cheer up himſelf, that the Lord hath hardened their hearts, and will not ſuffer them to profit by the means, but permits them to poſt on the way to hell.</p>

Here we find, that thoſe whom the Lord doth pleaſe to juſtifie, and ſanctifie, and to pour the clean waters upon their ſoules, and to cleanſe them from the filthineſſe of their ſins, to them he giveth a heart of fleſh: this is a work of <hi>God</hi> vouchſafed, (to ſuch that <hi>God</hi> doth cleanſe &amp; mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie,) even a flexible, plyable, and yeelding heart to the Word of God, and the means of grace, and of ſalvation: Oh haſt thou ſuch a heart? bleſſe God for it: this is a ſpecial mercy of God; for of all the plagues that befall men in this world, hardneſſe of heart is the worſt, none worſe then that, that is the moſt dreadful: ſo ſoftneſſe of heart (aſſuredly) is a ſpecial bleſſing of God, and given to none but thoſe whom God loveth. Oh then labour to have this
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108302:81"/> bowing, bending, yeelding heart to the good hand of God; labour to cheer it up, and to have a plyable heart, yeelding, not ſtubborn; and to that end, uſe theſe meanes that may mollifie thee more and more, namely, be frequent, and often in hearing and reading of the holy Word of God, and when thou haſt heard; and read it, ſecond it by meditation.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Apoſtle having cleared God from the imputation of inconſtancy, and of unfaithfulneſſe in his promiſes, notwithſtanding the rejection of the Jewes for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of them, from the ſixth verſe of this Chapter, to the 14. verſe: and having proved from the 14 verſe to the 19. verſe, that God is not unjuſt, in that he hath out of his own abſolute good will and pleaſure, choſen ſome to life and ſalvation, and hath paſſed by and rejected others, and that without reſpect had to any thing in them, or foreſeen in them; having I ſay cleared God from this ſlander, He now in this 19. verſe, falleth upon a new and a further Cavil and reaſoning of the fleſh, namely, ſuch a Cavil, as doth charge God with no leſſe then cruelty, and with Tyrannical dealing with ſome men, and from this the Apoſtle cleareth God alſo.</p>
               <p>Now the occaſion of this Cavil is from the verſe foregoing, where the Apoſtle ſaith, God hardeneth whom he will; hereupon fleſh and blood beginneth to cavil againſt God, and to riſe up and ſwell againſt him, and to charge him with no leſſe then cruelty, and extream hard dealing, in that the Lord ſhould harden men, and then complain of the hardening of man. And this Cavil which might haply be charged upon God, by humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he firſt propounds, and then Anſwers unto it: he propounds it in this 19. verſe, and anſwereth unto it, in the 20, 21, 22, and 23. Verſes.</p>
               <p>Now in propounding this Cavil, the Apoſtle maketh way unto it, in the firſt place, by putting down of the perſon of a Caviller, and by bringing the Caviller ſpeaking thus, <hi>(Thou wilt ſay then unto me,)</hi> and ſecondly he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:108302:81"/> ſetteth down the matter of the Cavil, or Objection, and that by way of interrogation, very emphatically, <hi>Why doth he yet complain?</hi> And thus the Objection may be framed; Reprobates and wicked men are hardened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Will of God that they ſhould be hardened; as you have taught us in the verſe before; and therefore God cannot juſtly blame, or puniſh them for their hardneſſe, for it is according to his will: For if God do blame and puniſh them for their hardneſſe, ſurely it ſeemeth to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of fleſh and blood, to be extream cruelty and rigour, God ſeemeth to be extremely rigorous, and a cruel God, in puniſhing men for their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>And this Cavil is further backed, by a proof, <hi>for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> as if the Caviller had ſaid; Why none can reſiſt Gods will, his will is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible, and it cannot be withſtood; and therefore if God firſt of all har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and then complain, it is extreme rigour and cruelty; ſo that if wicked men and Reprobates be hardened, it is according to the will of God, and ſo they are hardened unavoidably, and of neceſſity; God hath decreed their hardening, and he will have it ſo, and none can gainſay his will: And therefore it is no leſſe then Tyranny in God, to blame and puniſh men for it. And thus much we are to conceive of the generality of this 19. verſe, firſt, the Cavilling perſon, <hi>Thou wilt then ſay unto me;</hi> ſecondly, the Cavil, <hi>why doth he yet complain?</hi> and thirdly, the proof of the Cavil, <hi>for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come we now to the ſenſe and meaning of the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou wilt ſay then unto me,] Thou;</hi> who is this the Apoſtle meaneth? that is, thou, whoſoever thou art, that art a carnal Reaſoner, and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth according to carnal Reaſon, thou wilt ſay unto me, <hi>(why doth he yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain?)</hi> that is, why doth God complain of ſuch as be hardened? why doth God find fault with them, and threaten ſuch as are hardened? what cauſe hath the Lord to complain, threaten, or puniſh ſuch as are hardened, they being hardened according to his will? thus the carnal Caviller reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: for ſaith the Caviller, <hi>who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> that is, none was ever able to ſtand againſt, to fruſtrate, or make void the will of God; the purpoſe of God was never reſiſted, none was ever able to ſtand againſt his will, and to hinder it from taking place, and being effected: Gods decree and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is irreſiſtible, that none can withſtand it, therefore ſaith the Carnal Reaſoner, God hath no juſt cauſe to complain; ſo that the ſenſe in brief is thus much,
<q>Thou that art a Carnal Caviller art ready to except againſt my ſpeech, in that I ſay, God hardeneth whom he will; thou wilt ſay, if this be ſo, Paul, why doth God threaten Judgement, hell, and damnation, againſt thoſe that are hardened? what cauſe is there that God ſhould complain, find fault, threaten, and puniſh them with hell and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? for who ever reſiſted the will of the Lord? was there ever any man that was able to ſtand againſt the will of the Lord? no, no man! and ſo they are hardened of neceſſity, unavoidably, according to your own Doctrine, Paul: ſo that this is the meaning of the Apoſtles ſpeech.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now come we to matter of Obſervation and Doctrine. And firſt of all obſerve here, the Apoſtle bringeth in a Caviller, and a Carnal Reaſoner, as it were objecting, and inferring upon his former ſpeech, that God har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth whom he will; this Concluſion, the cauſe being ſo, God harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whom he will, then God hath no juſt cauſe to complain of mans har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening: ſo that hence ariſeth this Concluſion,</p>
               <p>That mans carnal reaſon, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                  </label> doth commonly gather and infer wrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions from true grounds of Religion, and true points of Divinity. And therefore from Divine and holy truths of God, and eſpecially ſuch truths as are of a high Nature, (as Gods election and reprobation are) doth
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:108302:82"/> mans corrupt and carnal reaſon, commonly infer, inforce, and bring erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and falſe Concluſions; it is a common thing with mans reaſon: ſee this is manifeſt by farther places of Scripture, in Rom. 3. from the fifth verſe to the ninth verſe, The Apoſtle having delivered this truth of God, that Gods goodneſſe, and Gods truth are commended, and ſet out by mans ſin, (accidentally God bringeth good out of evil,) hereupon ſome Carnal Reaſoners are ready to except againſt this Doctrine; Oh ſay they, how can God juſtly puniſh ſin? this the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the perſon of the Caviller, if our unrighteouſneſſe ſet forth Gods righteouſneſſe, then God cannot juſtly puniſh ſin. So in the ſeventh verſe of the ſame Chapter, <hi>If Godt glory hath abounded through my lye, why then am I puniſhed?</hi> ſaith the carnal man, God cannot then juſtly puniſh me for my lying: ſo in Joh. 3.3. The Lord Jeſus having put this down as a certain truth, that except a man be born again he cannot enter into the Kingdome of <hi>God.</hi> Nicodemus, hearing this after a carnal manner, and reſting in his own carnal reaſon; ſee what an abſurd concluſion he bringeth in upon this, then it ſeemeth that a man muſt enter into his mothers womb and be born again. So in John 6.53, 54. Chriſt ſhewing, that <hi>except a man eat his fleſh, and drink his blood, he hath no life in him:</hi> Now ſome that heard this, they heard it with great indignation, and ſtumbled at it, and they ſaid, <hi>This is a hard ſaying, who can bear it, muſt we eate this mans fleſh, and drink his blood?</hi> and they ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving carnally, concluded as the Papiſts doe now in their Doctrine of of Tranſubſtantiation, that we muſt eat the body of Chriſt, and drink his bloud corporally, and after a carnal manner; yea, they ſo ſtumbled at it, that they forſook him; inſomuch that he ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>What will you be gone from me alſo, doe you conceive of my words as the Capernaits did,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>My words are ſpirit and life, and you conceive of them with carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and gather from my points falſe concluſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe carnal reaſon <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                  </label> is blinde in Divine matters, in things that be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and ſpiritual, it cannot diſcern and look into the depth of them, it ſticketh in the rine, barke and outſide of Spiritual and divine Truths; it cannot find out the pith and marrow of it, carnal reaſon ſticketh in the very letter of the truth, and never looketh to the Divine myſterie of it, ſo that it is no marvel that carnal reaſon is ſticking in the rine and outſide of truths becauſe it is blind.</p>
               <p>Hence then take we notice of it, whence it is that erring ſpirits do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1:</label> faſten foul and falſe concluſions upon the Holy and Divine truths of God, becauſe they look upon them with a carnal eye. As from that ſound and Holy Doctrine of God, touching his abſolute Decree to life and ſalvation of ſome, and his rejection to damnation of others; hereupon ſome erring ſpirits do conclude, and they think it followeth neceſſarily, that therefoe God is a Tirant, and dealeth tirannically with his people.</p>
               <p>So again, ſome hearing this Holy Truth of God, that God hath a hand in every act of man that cometh to paſſe, and in the act of every creature, that Gods providence is in every thing that cometh to paſſe in the world, then the carnal reaſoner bringeth in this falſe concluſion, that then God is the authour of ſinne, and he thinketh in his judgement it followeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily that God is the authour of ſinne, becauſe ſin is an act. And (beloved) do not the Papiſts deal thus in the matter of Juſtification of a ſinner in the ſight of God? They hearing that a ſinner is juſtified in the ſight of God onely by faith, then (ſay the Papiſts) this Doctrine hath a foule taile coming after it, for it doth diſpoſſeſſe mans heart from all care, and indevour of good works, and hereupon (ſlanderouſly) they give out this falſe report of us, that in this Doctrine that men are juſtified onely by Faith, they ſay we are utter enemies to God, utter enemies to Gods Law, and utter enemies to all good works, this they think they may lawfully charge upon us.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:108302:82"/>
               <p>Thus theſe and many others doe wreſt falſe concluſions from the Holy Truth of God; and why? Becauſe they look upon them by the rule of natural reaſon, which is the ground of all Atheiſtical concluſions, there catching and ſnatching, and carping againſt the Divine Truths and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of God, becauſe they ſtick in the rinde, and dive not into the depth of them.</p>
               <p>Again, beloved is this ſo, that carnal reaſon doth wreſt falſe concluſions, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> from the holy and Divine truths of <hi>God?</hi> Then this muſt teach every one of us our dutie, to take heed that we meaſure not divine Truths by the meatyard and rule of our own carnal reaſon, eſpecially ſuch holy Truths of God as are of a high nature and ſtrain, ſuch as are tranſcendent, ſuch as goe beyond and extend the compaſſe of natural reaſon, ſuch truths as are matters of Faith, and above reaſon. Oh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> take heed of meaſuring theſe by the rule of natural reaſon.</p>
               <p>For if we ſeek to bring theſe Truths, within the model, ſcantling, and rule of our natural reaſon, we ſhall run into many by-paths and erroneous conceits and opinions, as he muſt needs loſe his way, that knoweth not the way, and followeth blinde guides. So <hi>(Fides eſt oculus animi)</hi> Faith is the eye of the ſoul, and if we in matters of Divinitie and high points of <hi>God,</hi> follow your own blind reaſon, we ſhall aſſuredly run into many groſs errours; yea beloved, let me tell you, it is a dangerous thing to hear or read the Word of <hi>God</hi> with a carnal underſtanding, and an unſanctified wit; for if we ſo doe, we ſhall abuſe the holy word of <hi>God,</hi> and wreſt from it ſuch concluſions, as are not there to be found: doth yet experience ſhew it to be true?</p>
               <p>Are there not ſome, who looking upon that place of the Apoſtle, in 1 Timothy 5.8. where he ſaith, <hi>He that provideth not for his own, and namely, for them of his Family, is worſe then an Infidel:</hi> doe not ſome I ſay looking upon this with a ſhut eye and carnal underſtanding, gather and conclude, that therefore they may pinch, and ſpare, and ſcrape together by all means and live a baſe and ſordid life, and not part with a farthing token to the poore, or to any good uſe but niggardly utter theſe words, they muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themſelves, and they may come to live by the almes of the Pariſh themſelves, and will not ſpare a pennie more then by the Law they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced and compelled, and ſo pervert the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Again, ſome others looking upon that place in Ezekiel 16.11, 12, 13. verſes, where the Lord ſaith, <hi>He decked Hieruſalem with Ornaments, with Bracelets, with goodly Jewels, with golden Crowns, and with Gold and ſilver, and Imbroydered works;</hi> Doe not ſome hereupon gather, that therefore they may be vain in their Apparel, and may follow every new faſhion, and may goe like ruffians in their long haire and foretop: and think this is their warrant; whereas they are deceived, for the Lord there ſpeaketh by way of ſimilitude, tropically that the Lord had bleſſed them with all good things, and ſo expreſſeth it after that manner figuratively, and they would have him ſpeak properly, and ſo they draw a falſe concluſion from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word of God.</p>
               <p>Thus I might inſtance in many particulars, that it is a dangerous thing to hear or read the Word of God with a carnal eye; yea, I dare boldly affirm that we ſhall never rightly conclude from any part of the Word of God, whether touching manners, or touching heavenly things, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with fleſh and bloud, unleſſe our eyes be annointed with the eye ſalve of the ſpirit of God. Therefore to conclude, learn we in reading the word of God to lay aſide our own reaſons to come with the eyes of the minde ſhut, and to look with the eye of Faith and of the Spirit of God, lay aſide thy owne reaſon, yea, thy owne wiſedome; for the wiſedome of man is enmitie to God, Romans 8.7, Yea, the beſt act and exerciſe of the mind of man not ſanctified, it is enmitie to the will of God; therefore let us

And ſo they put aſide the abſolute decree of God, and make it to depend upon the obſtinacy of man: ſo that we ſee they quite cut away this Cavil, and leave no place for it, and ſo they pervert and quite overthrow the purpoſe of this text; but this which they alledge is falſe, for this is that which reaſon doth ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at, and cannot conceive that God ſhould harden mens hearts. and then complain of their hardening; that God out of his own mere will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hardeneth them, and then puniſheth them for hardening, this cannot poſſibly but be unjuſt; this is the ſtumbling block of the carnal reaſoning of man, this is that which maketh carnal reaſon to riſe up and inſult againſt God; why doth <hi>God</hi> complain, when he doth of purpoſe harden men? ſo that the Arminians reaſoning, and this Objection cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

This we find was the practice of our firſt parents, (ſo ancient is it, as from the beginning of the world,) for when Adam had ſinned, and God cometh to call him to account for his ſin, we ſee Adam putteth off the blame of his ſin from himſelf to his wife, and in her to <hi>God</hi> himſelf; for he ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.12. <hi>The woman which thou gaveſt me, gave it me;</hi> and when he came to the woman, ſhe put it on the Serpent; ſo that here is a putting and poſting off of the blame from one to another, Adam to his wife, yea to <hi>God</hi> himſelf, and ſhe to the Serpent: and we, beloved, have ſucked the ſame milk, and drawn out the ſame poyſon, and

                  <p>Again further, this Cavil and this reaſoning of the fleſh, it is farther to be conſidered, together with the proof of it, in the words following, <hi>for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> As if the carnal Reaſoner ſhould ſay thus; That men are hardened it is the will of God it ſhould be ſo, God hardeneth whom he will, and Gods will cannot be reſiſted, none can ſtand againſt his will; and ſo men that are hardened, they are hardened unavoidably, out of neceſſity, for they muſt be hardened whom God will harden; and therefore they cannot juſtly be blamed, or taxed. Now then from hence ariſeth this Queſtion to be diſcuſſed.</p>
                  <p>Whether men are excuſable and free from blame, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Now to anſwer this queſtion, that men are excuſable; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> mans reaſon will yeeld unto, and that they are to be freed from blame, becauſe Gods will is ſo, and Gods will is irreſiſtible: But the true Anſwer is, that men are not free from blame; but they are juſtly to be taxed, and God doth juſtly puniſh men for their hardneſs &amp; ſins, and for their evil doings, they are blame-worthy.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:108302:84"/> And why? becauſe though Gods will and work, be in mens hardening, and in the ſinnes that come from the hardening of their hearts; yet doth not Gods will enforce hardneſſe upon them, making their hearts hard, that were before ſoft, neither doth Gods will compel men, to the committing of thoſe ſins which they run into, there is no ſuch matter, Gods will doth neither harden being ſoft, nor thruſt their ſins out from them. But for the underſtanding of this, we muſt know, that our firſt parents, they broke the Commandement of God, in eating the forbidden fruit willingly, being not forced thereunto by Gods Decree, as the Arminians, and Anabaptiſts hold, but they fell willingly, they had free will to ſtand or to fall. And Adam and Eve, of their own accord, put out their hands, and did eat of the forbidden fruit. And thereupon having broken Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they brought upon themſelves, and upon all their poſterity, ſin, and hardneſſe of heart; all that come from them by natural generation, have ſucked the ſame milk, and have natural hardneſſe of heart: and now men being in their natural hardneſſe, the Lord is pleaſed to withhold his ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace from ſome amongſt men, and to leave them in their natural hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; the Lord in his juſt Judgment doth inflict farther hardneſſe upon the hearts of men, as a juſt Judgment of their hardneſſe before, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by nature being willing to continue in their hardneſſe; ſo that God doth not thruſt further hardneſſe upon the hearts of men unwillingly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will be hardened or no.</p>
                  <p>And again, thoſe ſinnes that follow upon the hardneſſe of their hearts, are not drawn from men againſt their will whether they will or no, but they doe freely and willingly conſent unto ſinne, they give their free vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie conſent unto ſinne, they ſinne with a delight, they doe according to their own will, and according to the natural inclination thereof, the Lords will moving their will as he moveth the Heavens in a round Circle, according to the motion of it; ſo he doth move and order mans will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the motion of it, being evil, and ſo they freely and voluntarily commit ſinne, and ſo they ſinne of neceſſitie, but how? not of neceſſitie of coaction or compulſion, as if they were inforced to ſinne, but by the very neceſſitie of mans nature, they are naturally inclined to evil and readie to commit evil, <hi>Gods</hi> will bending them to their own proper motion, and ſo they chooſe ſinne, and ſinne of neceſſitie of nature, and that will not excuſe them, they have brought the neceſſitie upon themſelves, and that will not free them from blame.</p>
                  <p>As for example, was Judas compelled to that ſinne for betraying his Maſter? No, his will was inclined unto it, and the will of <hi>God</hi> together with his will in that act inclined it as it were to betray the Lord Jeſus: ſo that this will not excuſe men that they doe ſinne of neceſſitie.</p>
                  <p>As for example, the Devil himſelf can doe nothing but evil, neceſſarily he doth evil, yet therefore he is not excuſable, becauſe he doth evil neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily by the ſtrength of his corrupt nature, that will not excuſe him.</p>
                  <p>So then thus conceive we concerning this matter, that men are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable nor free from blame, but the Lord may juſtly puniſh and plague them for their hardneſſe, and ſins proceeding from their hardneſſe, though it be ſo that Gods will is that they are hardened, and Gods will is irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible, becauſe though Gods will be in their hardening, and hath a ſtroake in it, yet Gods will doth neither force hardneſſe upon their hearts, nor cauſe them to ſin, but the Lord finding them naturally inclined to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that they are hardened by nature, they being willing to continue in it; neither doth the Lord force out thoſe ſins that come from the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mens hearts, but they do it freely, out of their own free conſent, for the Lord doth neither take away the will of man, nor the power of mans will, but the Lord doth onely order, govern, and diſpoſe their wills, and move it according to their own inclinations, they freely conſenting, being
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:108302:84"/> not thereunto forced, and therefore are juſtly to be blamed.</p>
                  <p>And for the application of it, <label type="milestone">

Indeed, (to prevent an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in the beginning,) the will of God revealed, is and may be daily withſtood and reſiſted; the Jewes did reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Prophets, as their Fathers did, Act. 7.51. And the Prophets do continually complain of this, that they are brazen-faced, ſtiff-necked, of iron ſinews, rebelling and reſiſting the will of God. But the ſecret will of God, the purpoſe of God, that cannot be withſtood. And to this purpoſe read the prayer of Jehoſhaphat, in the 2 Chron. 20.6. <hi>O Lord God of our Fathers, art not thou God in heaven? doſt not thou reign over all the Nations and Kingdomes of the heathen? in thy hand is might and power, and none is able to withſtand it.</hi> None can reſiſt thy will, it muſt needs take effect.

But mans will in this reſpect, receiveth not grace by compulſion, but freely, the will of man being then inclined, and then moved ſo to do, by the gracious will of the holy Spirit of God, and ſo it receiveth grace freely, and voluntarily, being made willing by the work of grace, and power of the Spirit. As God himſelf is by an abſolute neceſſity the willer of good, and his will cannot but will good, yet when he willeth good, he is not conſtrained to will good, but he willeth good moſt neceſſarily and freely. So on the contrary, ſome mens will is limited and determined to do evil, ſo as that he willeth evil of neceſſity; yet this mans ſo willing of evil, is free, and not by compulſion, it coming from the natural propenſion of his own will; ſo that though mans will be limited and determined to evil by the will of God, and to good, yet the will of man is free, becauſe in the very Act of willing he is not compelled either to good or evil; ſo that this we are to hold as a certain truth, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this objection, that the will of God is irreſiſtible, and cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood either by men or Angels.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Apoſtle now falleth upon his Anſwer to the Cavil, and to the objection of mans Reaſon, propounded in the Verſe foregoing. And the anſwer unto it is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, 1. Perſonally; and 2. Really: his perſonal anſwer to the Cavil, and carnal Reaſoner, is in the 20, and 21 Verſes: his Real anſwer is in the two verſes following, in the 22, and 23. Verſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all touching the perſonal anſwer, wherein he doth check the preſumption of the Carnal Reaſoner, and laboureth to take down his pride and ſwelling, by bringing him to a conſideration of his own baſeneſſe and nullity to God; ſaying, O man, what art thou that reaſoneſt againſt God? rebuking and checking his inſolency and pride, wherein we may obſerve the perſon reproving, and the party reproved, noted unto us in theſe words, <hi>O man,</hi> &amp;c. then he amplifieth this reproof of his of the Carnal Reaſoner, by a compariſon, and a ſimilitude; and by that he ſheweth what a Carnal Reaſoner is. As if ſo be a peece of wood, framed by the Carpenter, ſhould riſe up and quarrel with the Carpenter, for framing of him to this, or that purpoſe; or the Iron riſe up and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the Smith, why he did beat him to this or that faſhion; were not this inſolency and pride in the creature? Hereby implying, that man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108302:86"/> framed of God, ought not to queſtion, and to diſpute with God, and ſay, Why haſt thou made me hard-hearted.</p>
               <p>Then hereupon the Apoſtle directeth a particular inſtance, adding weight and force unto this ſimilitude and compariſon, namely, upon the power of the Potter over the clay, ſhall the clay riſe up againſt the Potter, hath not the Potter power over the clay, to make one veſſel to honour, and another to diſhonour? And thus ſtandeth the Reaſon, as the clay may not reaſon the cauſe with the potter, for making out of the ſame lump one veſſel to one uſe, and another to th'other; for the potter hath full power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the clay, to frame of it what veſſel he thinketh fit: ſo man is not to queſtion God; man is not to quarrel with God, or to call him to account for framing of him thus, or thus, for the Lord hath abſolute power to diſpoſe of man, even at his own good will and pleaſure, ſome to honour, and ſome to diſhonour. So that in the 21. verſe God is compared to a potter, and man to the clay that is wrought upon by the potter; and as it is lawful for the potter to frame out of the ſame lump of clay, one veſſel for better uſe and ſervice at the Table, and another for baſer uſe in the Chamber, you know what I mean: ſo, and much more is it lawful for the Lord to frame out of the ſame lump of earth, one man for ſalvation, and another for damnation, and diſhonour; ſo ſtandeth the Apoſtles reaſon: and ſo much for the general matter of theſe two Verſes, the 20. and 21. verſes.</p>
               <p>Now to enter upon theſe two verſes more particularly, ſomething is needful to be ſpoken, touching the ſenſe and meaning of theſe words; and firſt of the 20. verſe, <hi>O man,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>who art thou that ſpeakeſt againſt God? O man!</hi> here the Apoſtle ſpeaketh marvellous emphatically; he putteth it down with a great emphaſis, and hereby he calleth man to a conſideration of his own baſeneſſe; as if he had ſaid, O thou man, what art thou? or who art thou? conſider with thy ſelf, thou man, thou carnal Reaſoner, that takeſt upon thee to quarrel with God; why? thou art a vile baſe wretch, a lump of earth, a piece of clay, a worm, leſſe then a worm, nothing in compariſon of the great Majeſtie of God: Dareſt thou quarrel againſt the will and counſel of the Lord? art thou ſo malapert, ſo ſaucie, ſo ſhameleſſe, ſo far paſt all ſhame, as to call into queſtion the will and doings of the holy God? to call him to account, and to bring him within the compaſſe of thy carnal reaſon: O man full of impiety, do but conſider and premeditate what thou art, a baſe wretch; and what the Lord is, the great God of heaven and earth, and then judge what a mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert ſaucineſſe it is in thee. <hi>Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me ſo?</hi> do but conſider with thy ſelf, were it not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming thing, that a piece of Wood, or ſome ſuch like thing framed by the hand of ſome cunning Artificer, ſhould riſe up and ſay, Why haſt thou made me thus? thou art but a bungler: were it not prepoſterous, and a monſtrous thing in Nature? And what is it but as abſurd and groſſe for thee to argue and reaſon the cauſe with God, thy Creator, thy Maker, touching his diſpoſing of thee according to his will, and ſay, O Lord, why haſt thou made me thus, or thus, herein thou haſt ſhewed thy ſelf a bad workman: So that we may eaſily conceive the meaning of the Apoſtle, in this verſe, to be thus; as if the Apoſtle had ſaid,</p>
               <p>But O thou carnal Reaſoner, what art thou, a man? and therein conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who thou art being a man, and thou ſhalt find thy ſelf to be a baſe man, a vile man, a worm, and leſſe then a man, nothing in compariſon of the great God; and dareſt thou then queſtion God, and cavil againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will of the Lord? art thou ſo audacious, ſo bold, ſo malapert, as to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with him? dareſt thou that art but a ſilly worm, make thy carnal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt God? do but think with thy ſelf, were it a meet thing in nature, for a piece of wood, to riſe up againſt him that hath formed it, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:108302:86"/> to ſay to the Mechanical Artificer, why haſt thou made me of this baſe faſhion, thou art but a bungler, it is much more groſſe for thee to reaſon, and to argue the caſe with God, for diſpoſing of thee according to his will.</p>
               <p>Come we now to matter of Obſervation and Doctrine.<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> And firſt of all obſerve we, that our Apoſtle making anſwer to the carnal Reaſoner, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to bring him to a conſideration of his own vileneſſe, thereby checking his preſumption, in taking upon him to quarrel with the Lord; O man, ſaith he, who art thou, a prophane wretch, a worthleſſe thing, a worm, leſſe then a worm, nothing in compariſon of God. Hence then the obſervation is plain before us.</p>
               <p>That the due conſideration of what we are, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                  </label> being compared to what God is, is a notable means to beat down inſolency, preſumption, and pride in us, we entring in a due and ſerious conſideration of our own baſeneſſe, and our own vileneſſe, and indeed of our own nothingneſſe in compariſon of the infinite greatneſſe and glory of God, it is a ſpecial means to humble us, to beat down, and throw down the ſwelling pride of our own hearts; and that this is ſo, it is farther clear unto us, we find it ſo to be, in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe and lives of the Saints and holy ſervants of God, that the nearer they have approached to the preſence of the Lord, the more they have been humbled, and the more have they abaſed themſelves, in conſideration of their own vileneſſe and baſeneſſe, in compariſon of God, they drawing near to the great Omnipotency, and Omniſciency of God; thus did holy Abraham, in Gen. 18.22. he drawing near to the Lord in praying for the Sodomites, was brought into an humble conceit of himſelf, and thereupon he broke out in the 27. verſe of the ſame Chapter, <hi>Behold I have begun to ſpeak unto my Lord, and I am but dust and aſhes:</hi> he breaketh out into this perturbation, acknowledging he is but duſt and aſhes; who am I that I ſhould open my mouth to the great, holy, and glorious God? even as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of him; as it is ſaid of all Nations in the world, that that in reſpect of God they are vanity, and leſſe then nothing, Eſay 40.15, 17. the drop of a bucket, vanity, and leſſe then nothing. And to the ſame purpoſe we find the ſervants of God have been wonderfully troubled, caſt down, and affrighted, and brought to a great aſtoniſhment in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their own baſeneſſe, and vileneſſe, yea they have even trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and ſhaken, when they have had but a glympſe of him. Thus did Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noah, Judges 13.22. who having ſeen but an Angel of God, cryed out, alas, we ſhall ſurely dye, we have ſeen God. And the Prophet ſaith, Eſay 6.5. <hi>VVoe is me, I am undone, I am undone,</hi> (why what is the matter?) <hi>I am a man of polluted lips, and I dwell among a people of polluted lips, and mine eyes have ſeen the King the Lord of hosts;</hi> I have ſeen the great God of heaven and earth: ſo that we ſee this hath been made good unto us by evidence and teſtimony of Scripture; that the due conſideration of our vileneſſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Gods mightineſſe, is the onely meanes to work humility in us.</p>

So again, touching infants, ſhall we aske the reaſon why thoſe infants that die before they come to yeares of diſcretion, are not all ſaved, but ſome go to Heaven, and ſome to Hell, ſome belong to Gods Election, and ſome doe not; ſome are ſaved, ſome are not; Shall we queſtion and ſay, Oh Lord, why wouldſt thou have it ſo that poore infants ſhall be damned? No, no, the reaſon is hid from us; though it be true, that ſome infants are ſaved, and ſome are not; yet the cauſe of it is kept cloſe from us; and therefore we are not to ſeek into the ſecret Counſel of the Lord, we ſee in the world many things fall out wonderful ſtrangely; yea we ſee, as Salomon ſaith he did ſee, in Eccle. 7.17. <hi>I have ſeen a juſt man periſh in his juſtice, and I have ſeen a wicked man proſper a long time in his malice;</hi> and we may ſee it goeth ill with the good, and well with the bad; yea many times it goeth ill with the good, and that becauſe they are good, and it goeth well with the bad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are bad; therefore they are countenanced; and things ſeem to goe quite contrary, as if God had no providence over man, and we ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrange judgements and afflictions to befal other men, what then? Shall we hereupon diſpute with God, arguing the caſe with the Lord? and take upon us to demand of him the reaſon why theſe things come to paſſe, that it goeth ill with the good, and well with the bad, and theſe things ſeem to goe out of order, as if God had no care of them? No, no, for if we ſo doe, it is moſt monſtrous boldneſſe; and we run into the juſt cenſure of the Apoſtle in this place: What and who art thou, Oh Man, wilt thou take upon thee to demand the reaſon of God? Indeed, I confeſſe ſome of the deare and holy ſervants of God, have ſtumbled and taken a fall at this ſtone, as the Prophet Jeremiah, in the 12. Chapter and 1. Verſe ſaith, <hi>O Lord, if I diſpute with thee, thou art righteous, yet Lord let me talke with thee about thy judgements, why is it that the way of the wicked proſper? and they are in wealth that rebel and tranſgreſſe thy Law?</hi> And at the ſame ſtone Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid ſtumbled, in Pſalme 73.2. <hi>His foote was almoſt gone when he ſaw it to goe well with the wicked:</hi> This was the weakneſſe and infirmitie of the holy Saints and ſervants of God; we muſt learn both to thinke and to ſpeake with reverence, of the ſecret wayes and judgements of God, and to adore them, not to cavil againſt them; but to acknowledge them to be juſt, though the cauſe be ſecret: And that indeed in the middeſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions and diſorders that be in this world; when we ſee all things turned topſie turvie as it were; there is one that ſitteth at the ſtern, even the Lord of Heaven, and Earth, he ſitteth guiding the ſtern, and he will in his due time ſet things ſtreight, and bring them into order and ſquare; thus we are not to reaſon, but to reverence the ſecrets of the Lord. Indeed we are not to paſſe by the ſtrange works of God, and the ſtrange things we ſee or heare of in the world, without a due and ſerious conſideration of them, that is ſenſeleſſe blockiſhneſſe, and the fault of many men, that they paſſe over the works of the Lord, and never thinke of them, nor make uſe of them to ſee the wonderful power and greatneſſe of the Lord.</p>

                  <p>But we muſt take heed of being too quick ſighted and eagle eied to ſearch into the cauſe of things that fall out upon ſuch and ſuch people and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Men account it a degree of ſharpneſſe of wit, that they are able to finde out the cauſe of hidden things; But the Apoſtle calleth this meer dotage, in the 1 of Timothy, the 6. and the 4. <hi>If any man conſent not unto the Doctrine of godlineſs, he doteth about queſtions, and is a meer queſtioniſt;</hi> As the common Proverb is, <hi>[One foole may propound more queſtions in an houre then a thouſand wiſe men can anſwer truely in a yeare;]</hi> So that theſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioniſts are dolts and meer fools.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore labor to be quick ſighted in ſearching unto thoſe things that concern faith and a good Conſcience, leaving the matters of needleſſe and curious queſtions touching the ſecret things of <hi>God,</hi> as ſome doe; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Why am I thus or thus? and why are theſe times harder then the former?

And woe to the child that ſaith unto his father, why haſt thou begotten me? or to his mother, why haſt thou brought me forth? and in Numb. 14.3. we find that the people of Iſrael they quarrelled and found fault with God, and broke out into high and vile terms with God, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out with him, ſaying, <hi>VVherefore hath the Lord done this, to bring us to this Land, to fall upon the ſword?

                  <p>Yes, there be many in the world; what elſe do they but even find fault with God, touching his will in making and framing of them to this or that faſhion? in that they take upon them to mend Gods work, and to make themſelves better then ever God did make them, taking upon them to mend the work of God, as they do, that colour their hair, and paint their faces, and diſguiſe themſelves in antick, diſguiſed, and new fangled attire, they will make themſelves peacock like in their top and top gallants, that bring their hips up to their ſhoulders, ſurely ſuch perſons they are monſters amongſt men, and ſuch as are to be wondered at; and as they are now ſo proud, that they know not themſelves, they may juſtly fear, that when the Lord cometh to Judgment, the Lord will not know, nor acknowledg them, without ſpeedy repentance, but will ſay unto them, Away, hence, who gave you this coloured hair, this complexion on your painted cheeks, this antick diſguiſed body? did I? no, you would mend my work, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore away, i'le none of you, begone into utter deſtruction, <hi>depart from me ye workers of iniquity, I know you not,</hi> Matth. 7.22.</p>

Oh it were better for me that I had been made a rich Merchant, a Noble man, a ſtrong man, or a fair man, and not as I am; what is this but to flye in Gods face, and to pick a quarrel with him that hath formed them? this is for man, a ſilly creature, a worm leſſe then a worm, to turn againſt God; and as a worm being trod upon, doth turn again; ſo doth man bring upon himſelf a curſe and a woe, pronounced in Eſay 45.9. he that doth quarrel with his Creator, doth even daſh himſelf upon the rock of Gods heavy

Yea, much more hath the Lord power over Man, to make, to ordain, and to appoint (of the ſame lump:) Some doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand of the ſame lump to be meant the ſinne of Idolatrie, in which the Children of Iſrael were in Egypt: That the Lord out of that ſame lump of Idolatrie in which the Children of Iſrael were with the Egyptians, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Iſraelites, and deſtroyed the Egyptians; but this is too ſcantie, too narrow, and not large enough for to expreſſe the Apoſtles meaning; for the Apoſtles drift is not here of inflicting of puniſhment for that man can give a reaſon of, but the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of Gods ordaining, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing.</p>
               <p>And again, ſome Divines doe by this word lump underſtand the maſſe of corruption, mans fall, mans corrupting by Adams tranſgreſſion, Adam being wrapped in ſinne.</p>

                  </note>But though this be the opinion of many reverent Divines, yet it cannot be the Apoſtles meaning, becauſe as ſaith Reverend Beza, in this ſence the Lord cannot be ſaid to make men veſſels of diſhonour, but to finde men alreadie in their eſtate veſſels of diſhonour. Again, the compariſon it ſelf ſeems to exclude and ſhut out all reſpect to corruption, that there is no reſpect had to the corruption of man from everlaſting; for you ſee here God is compared to a Potter that taketh a piece of clay not ſtained with any pollution, corruption, ſpot or tincture, for then the Potter might have ſome excuſe to make a baſe veſſel of it; becauſe it was a ſpotted, and tainted piece of Clay, ſo God taketh man, as in himſelf not corrupted, for then there was ſome cauſe why the Lord ſhould caſt away this man, and not that man; therefore we are here to underſtand not man corrupted, but mankind generally taken, <hi>(One veſſel to honour, and another to diſhonour;)</hi> that is to make one veſſel to his Glory to honour everlaſting, and another to be veſſels of wrath to ſhame and confuſion.</p>
               <p>I know what the Anabaptiſts object againſt this, for they ſay it is very impious, groſſe and abſurd thus to expound this compariſon, this maketh God to have no wiſdome. For what Potter is ſo fooliſh to make his pots to break them, and to throw them away purpoſely, ſhall we ſay then, God made man to deſtroy him, to throw him to utter confuſion, ſo that ſay they this is a very impious Expoſition of the compariſons; But herein they ſhew their fooliſhneſs and weakneſs.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, we affirme no ſuch matter either of the Potter, or of God, that God makes man to deſtroy him; for what is it for God to deſtroy a man? It is when he confounds, and turneth man to nothing, when he doth annihilate and diſſolve him to nothing; but for God to finde a man in his corruption, to throw him into Reprobation, this is no deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a man.</p>
               <p>Again (beloved) the Potter is a Creature, and hath received a Law from God his Creatour, that he muſt carrie himſelf toward his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip according to his Law, that he may prove profitable, either to the Church, or to the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Now this he doth not if he make his Pots with a purpoſe to break them; then he liveth idlely and is a vain fooliſh fellow: But God the great Lord of Heaven and Earth, who hath made the world, he is not bound to any
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:108302:91"/> ſuch law will the Anabaptiſts in their foolerie bring God under a Law? he is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and he hath the Prerogative Royal, and he is bound to no Law, no more to preſerve them being made, then to make them of nothing when they were not; will they bring God under their girdle, and under their law? therefore notwithſtanding their cavil, the meaning remaineth a truth, and it is as if the Apoſtle had ſaid,<note place="margin">Sence and meaning of the words.</note> 
                  <hi>Hath not God power, and abſolute lawful authoritie over man; and as the Potter hath over the Clay, even out of the ſame lump and maſs of mankind, taken generally to appoint, and to ordain, one man to be his veſſel of mercy in life and glory in Heaven, and to another to be a veſſel of his wrath in the destruction of hell:</hi> And thus much for the Apoſtles meaning.</p>

               <p>And this therefore may bee reprofe to ſuch Preachers, that doe in preaching to a common populous Auditorie, they fetch compariſons from things beyond the Moon, from Celeſtial bodies and orbes Centrivals and Concentrivals I know not what, and alſo from things beyond ſea, from Hiſtories out of Plinie, beaſts aad creatures that vulgar people know not, <label type="milestone">

And in the 2 Cor. 5.1. The Apoſtle calleth our bodies, <hi>Earthly houſes, tents and tabernacles made of earth and clay.</hi> The Scripture is plain and plentiful in expreſſing this to be a Truth, that man, yea the ſtrongeſt man is but an earthen veſſel, and a compound of clay; and we may ſee this to be a truth in common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the ſoul being removed from the body by death the body falleth flat upon the ground, it rots, putrifies, and is ſoon diſſolved to the Elements, and materials of which it was made, and lieth like a ſtinking carrion if not buried, and turns to the earth of which it was, Eccle. 12.7. <hi>Duſt returneth to the earth as it was.</hi>
               </p>

A lump of earth, a clod of clay, and if this were truely conſidered, it would abate the pride of theſe proud Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks, that ſpend almoſt a whole day in tricking and trimming themſelves; nay, in ſetting of a band, they would then ſay, what do I in tricking and

But grant this to be true, that thou excelleſt others in beautie, and in comely proportion, yet remember thy making, thy mettal whereof thou art made, of the ſame earth with others, and for all thy beautie and comely proportion, a little cold, a little ſickneſſe, a fit of an ague, or feaver will ſhake thee, and make the ſhrink, and goe ſhaking and quaking, and as David ſaith, Pſalme 39.11.

                  <p>That God hath lawful power and authority over man, to ordain, and <label type="milestone">

And to this purpoſe in the very ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon ſpeaketh the Lord, to the houſe of Iſrael, by the Prophet Jeremiah, in Jer. 18.6. <hi>O houſe of Iſrael, cannot I do with you, as the Potter doth with his clay; as the clay is in the hand of the Potter, ſo are you in my hand, O houſe of Iſrael.</hi> As the Potter may do with his clay what he will, ſo may I with you; and in Luke 12.6.

                  <p>This ſerveth as one ſpecial ground, to clear God of injuſtice and wrong doing, that he hath appointed ſome men to life and glory in heaven, <label type="milestone">

But they are deceived; for why? we know tyrants they do their own will, either with men, or againſt them, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their pleaſure is ſo, they reſpect neither law, nor equity, nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſo he may do his will, and have his pleaſure; this is the manner of a Tyrant: Now <hi>God</hi> he ordaineth men to ſeveral ends, not onely accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:108302:93"/> to his own good pleaſure, but according to the lawfulneſſe of his good pleaſure, as he may lawfully do, and as he hath lawful power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; whereas the Tyrant careth not, whether it be right or wrong, he will break through all the bounds of truth and law; there is no ſuch matter with the Lord, but the Lord he doth it according to his lawfull power, and lawful authority to diſpoſe of men, to do with them as he will; the tyrant hath not ſo.</p>
                  <p>And again, there is a large and wide difference between God and a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, both in reſpect of their wills, and alſo in regard of their ends: As firſt of all, the will of Tyrants, what is it? according to their own luſts, and their own pleaſure; and they being wicked and ſinful, make their wills as wicked and ſinful: but the Will of God, (God being moſt holy,) it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his nature, and his nature being holy and pure, his Will is moſt holy and pure.</p>
                  <p>Again, Tyrants reſpect wicked ends, in dealing hardly with their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, in taking away their lives, and their liberties, and that is to ſatisfie their own cruel and bloody minds. But now the purpoſe of <hi>God</hi> in dealing with men, reſpecteth the praiſe of his glory, and of his mercy; which two ends are ever holy and good: the ends of Tyrants are according to their Tyranny, but the end of the Lord, in ordaining ſome to ſhame, and ſome to honour, is the glory of his Juſtice and mercy: and therefore it doth not follow from hence, that we make God cruel, and Tyrannical, becauſe we affirm, that God hath out of his mere good will and pleaſure appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome to ſhame, and ſome to honour, becauſe the Lord hath power ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>And this ſhould teach us to be ſo far from charging God with Tyranny, and indeed to drive this further, we are not ſuffer once ſuch a thought to ariſe in our hearts, that God dealeth hardly with us in any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, no not when thy eſtate ſeemeth unto fleſh and blood to be moſt deſperate; nay we are to be far from this, to think that God dealeth hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with us, nay when we are under the hand of <hi>God,</hi> in ſome great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous diſtreſſe, let us then remember thus much, and think with our ſelves, the Lord hath lawful authority, to appoint men to everlaſting deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: now if the Lord hath not thus dealt with us, but given us a better and everlaſting eſtate to life and glory; Oh how can we think that <hi>God</hi> dealeth hardly with us in any thing, he having evidenced his love unto us in Chriſt Jeſus; no, though our diſtreſſes be but at the height, and we in the deepeſt mire of miſery,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Again, we conſidering, that the lump of clay is here to be conſidered untainted, free from tincture, and pollution; ſo we are to conceive of mankind, in the making of him free from corruption.</p>

And hence it is that the Apoſtle determineth Gods predeſtination, his chooſing of ſome to life, and reprobating of others, in the good will and pleaſure of God, in

                     </label> it beareth ſtrongly againſt the opinion of ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſpirits, as namely thoſe that ſay, that God in appointing men to their final ends, had reſpect to ſomething in man, as either to their faith, and good works, or to their unbelief, and obſtinacy in ſin. Now this doth not onely make the will of the Lord dependent upon mans will, that if men will be ſaved, they ſhall; if not, damned; but this opinion of theirs, if we mark and obſerve it, it maketh a diſſimilitude between God and the Potter, which are here put together in affinity, and agreement; But this doth overturn and contradict it: And if this be true, then this text is not true; for if God had reſpect to ſomething in man, ſurely then God need not appoint any perſon definitively nor certainly to be a veſſel of honour, but conditionally, if they did believe. And ſo they make God to frame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers perſons, diverſly qualified, to divers ends, and that with reſpect had to their qualification, all men if they believe, ſhall be ſaved; if not, none.

But in this place the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the office and duty of Chriſtians; and he ſheweth how a Chriſtian muſt carry himſelf different from a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and anſwerable, that he may be a veſſel of honour ſanctified, and purged from the droſſe of Corruption, and from the ſin and ſinful courſes of the world.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe two Verſes our Apoſtle he maketh a real An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Caviller, and Carnal Reaſoner; the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viller reaſoneth thus, (from the words of the Apoſtle) that ſome men are hardened, it is the will of God, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, he hardeneth whom he will: what reaſon is there then that God ſhould complain of ſuch men that are hatdened? the will of God is irreſiſtible, it cannot be withſtood, and you teach us, God har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth whom he will: what then (ſaith the Caviller) hath God to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of? Now herein firſt our Apoſtle doth check the Cavillers ſauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and malapertneſſe in the 20. verſe, <hi>Who art thou, O man?</hi> ſhewing the abſurdity of the reaſoning againſt God; and it is as if the formed thing ſhould ſay to the former, why haſt thou made me thus? amplifying that, by a ſimilitude of the Potter; whereby the Apoſtle implyeth, that as the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may lawfully do with his clay what he will, and frame out of it ſeveral veſſels, to ſeveral uſes; ſo may the Lord ordain ſome men to life and glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſome to ſhame and confuſion.</p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle having thus made way to the Real Anſwer, now he cometh to it, and ſheweth, that God may lawfully puniſh Reprobates for their hardneſſe. And that God is juſt in threatening and puniſhing men for their hardneſſe of heart; this he proveth by the Lords manner of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Reprobates, becauſe (ſaith he) the Lord ſuffereth them with long patience; as if he had ſaid, though the Lord had decreed their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and caſting off for ever; yet before the Lord hath executed any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of his puniſhment, he ſuffereth them with long patience to continue, that he may the better declare his juſt wrath and Judgment upon them, and his power in them, and may make known the riches of his mercy toward his choſen.</p>
               <p>Now more particularly we have in theſe two Verſes (the 22. and 23.) two things laid before us; Firſt of all, a deſcription both of Reprobates, and of Gods Elect. And ſecondly, that which the Apoſtle affirmeth, and putteth down concerning Reprobates; theſe be the main general things; Reprobates are thus deſcribed by the Apoſtle, <hi>veſſels of wrath,</hi> and thoſe prepared to deſtruction; Gods Elect are thus deſcribed, veſſels of mercy prepared unto glory; both veſſels, but the one of wrath, and the other of mercy; one prepared to deſtruction, the other prepared to life and glory.</p>
               <p>Now the thing which the Apoſtle putteth down concerning Reprobates, is, that God ſuffereth them, with long, and much patience, and that out of his own mere will and good pleaſure, <hi>(what if God would ſuffer the veſſels of wrath?)</hi> then the Apoſtle amplifieth this long-ſuffering of God to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, by the ends of Gods long-ſuffering and patience, namely, in reſpect of Reprobates themſelves, to declare and manifeſt his juſt wrath and vengeance upon them, for the Manifeſtation and Declaration of his juſt power in puniſhing of them, then in reſpect of Gods Elect, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might ſhew forth the riches of his glorious mercy to the Elect, in the 23. verſe, <hi>that he might declare the riches of his mercy unto them that are prepared for glory:</hi> ſo we have the general things of theſe two Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

               <p>Come we now to the opening of the ſenſe of theſe two verſes;<note place="margin">Explication of the words.</note> and firſt of all of the 22. verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What if God would,]</hi> What if God being willing, or it being his good pleaſure; and here ſomething muſt be ſupplyed, to make it a perfect ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, ſomething muſt be conceived as a Conſequent, what if it be the good will and pleaſure of the Lord to ſuffer the veſſels of wrath to go to deſtruction, with long patience? what if God will ſo do? what is that to thee: (this maketh it a perfect ſentence,) what canſt thou accuſe God of in this particular?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>to ſhew his wrath,]</hi> By <hi>wrath,</hi> is here meant both Gods diſpleaſure for and againſt ſin, and Gods vengeance for the ſame: and God is ſaid to manifeſt and ſhew his wrath, when he conceiveth juſt diſpleaſure againſt men for their ſins, and doth inflict juſt Judgment, and juſt puniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>and to make his power known]</hi> Or, as it is in the Original, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to make it poſſible;</hi> to make it appear, that it is poſſible and eaſie unto God, that God hath power to confront and bear down the Reprobates, be they never ſo mighty, with a ſtroke of his hand, and to ſend them ſoul and body to deſtruction; as it is, 1 Sam. 2.10. all the adverſaries of the Lord ſhall periſh, they ſhall be deſtroyed and confounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ſuffer with long patience]</hi> Or, <hi>with long-ſuffering;</hi> for the word is the very ſame, as in Rom. 2.4. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>deſpiſeſt thou the patience and long-ſuffering of the Lord?</hi> now Gods long ſufferance is his ſlowneſſe to anger, Exod. 34.6. where the Lord is deſcribed to be ſlow to anger; and Gods long ſufferance, and ſlowneſſe to anger is, when he beareth with them a long time, and keepeth back his wrath; ſuffering them to go on; and to add ſin unto ſin, he ſpareth them a long time when he might ſtrike, and ſuddenly ſend them to hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>veſſels of wrath]</hi> The Apoſtle ſtill is in the compariſon of a Potter, and compareth man to a veſſel, a veſſel of wrath; and though by veſſel, may be underſtood any inſtrument or utenſel, uſed about a houſe; yet hereby is meant ſuch a veſſel, which by reaſon of his concavity and hollowneſſe, is fit to receive, and contain, either things liquid or dry: ſo the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates being veſſels, they have this concavity, this hollowneſſe in them, they are fit receptacles, and veſſels to receive the wrath of God, and the arrows of his vengeance: yet (for the better underſtanding of this,) we muſt put here a difference between a veſſel of wrath, and a child of wrath, theſe are not both one. Now a child of wrath for the preſent eſtate,<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a veſſel of wrath, and a Child of wrath.</note> may be a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of mercy, ſo was Paul, ſo were the Elect Epheſians, Epheſ. 2.3. we were by nature children of wrath, as well as others; but a veſſel of wrath cannot become a veſſel of mercy; and of thoſe ſpeaketh our Apoſtle here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>prepared to Deſtruction.]</hi> Expoſitors in this place do make a very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſtinction, between theſe termes, <hi>prepared to deſtruction, and prepared to glory;</hi> the one (ſay they) is ſpoken in the paſſive, <hi>prepared to deſtruction;</hi> the other in the active, <hi>he prepareth them to glory:</hi> but this is a needleſſe diſtinction; for this is to be expounded by ſome other places of Scripture; as that in 1 Theſſ. 5.9. where veſſels of wrath are ſaid to be prepared and ordained of God; the Lord having in his eternal decree, ordained and appointed them to everlaſting ſhame and confuſion, as a potter maketh a veſſel to receive excrements; ſo theſe are appointed to deſtruction, not as it is a miſery of the creature, but as it is a manifeſtation of his glory who is the Creator, which he will have made known to all the world.</p>
               <p>So then thus conceive we the meaning of the Apoſtle, in this 22. verſe;<note place="margin">Sence and meaning of the words of the <hi>22.</hi> verſe.</note> What if God be willing, out of his good pleaſure, that he might conceive juſt wrath, and inflict and execute juſt Judgment, and that he might make it appear, that he is a God of power, and able to confront the Reprobate,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:108302:95"/> and to bring them to deſtruction; What if God willing, to keep back his wrath, even with long patience, ſuffering ſuch as are fit receptacles to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his vengeance, as any veſſel by reaſon of concavity to receive water, I mean Reprobates, ſuch as God hath eternally decreed to deſtruction, not as it is the miſery of the creature, but as it maketh way for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and declaration of the Juſtice of God? but if the Lord will ſo do, what is that to thee? what canſt thou ſay againſt it, if the Lord will ſo do?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note>Come we now to the Obſervation: You ſee here in the general, that both <hi>Gods</hi> Elect, and Reprobates are compared to veſſels framed by the hand of God the heavenly Potter, hence note we thus much:</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                  </label> That Gods Elect and Reprobates differ not in their matter at all, they are both of them veſſels, and have both one general nature, and are alike, but the difference is in the uſe.</p>
               <p>They are both made of the ſame lump, by the ſame Potter, but they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the uſe; he uſeth the one as veſſels of mercie, the others as veſſels of wrath; Gods Elect, they are veſſels fit to receive grace, goodneſſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, ſanctification, all good things are poured into their hearts and ſoules, but the other they are fit to receive nothing but the ſinke of ſinne, and all manner of uncleanneſſe it tumbleth down into them. Hence it is that the Lord Jeſus in Acts 9.15. ſpeaking of Saul afterwards called Paul, ſaith unto Ananias, that his purpoſe was to ſend him unto the Gentiles, and he calleth him a choſen veſſel, a veſſel fit to receive grace, and to bear the Name of Chriſt to all Nations.</p>
               <p>And of the reprobate Heathen, the Apoſtle ſaith in Romans 1.29. God gave them up to a reprobate ſence, to receive the fulneſſe of all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when the Lord did poure out the tokens of his wrath, they were full of all uncleanneſſe. And alſo the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the reprobate Jewes in 1 Theſſ. 2.15, 16. That they killed the Lord Jeſus, and their owne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, perſecuted us, and they are contrarie to all men, and they forbid us to preach to the Gentiles, and they fill up the meaſure of their ſins, becauſe the wrath of God is come upon them unto the uttermoſt.</p>

But he alſo beareth with wicked and ungodly perſons, though they goe on adding ſinne unto ſinne, provoking him to wrath, and to their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction daily, when he might ſuddenly ſend them to the pit of Hell: And for proofe of this we have not onely evidence here, but in Pſalme 50. The Pſalmiſt bringeth in God ſpeaking to the wicked and ungodly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing their wicked and lewd behaviour from the 16. verſe to the 21. verſe, in this manner, that they hate to be reformed, caſt the Word of God behind them, run with the adulterer and the theefe, ſit with the ſlanderer, and joyn hands with all manner of wicked perſons, and no ſinne came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe unto them: And then he ſubjoyneth, theſe things haſt thou done, and I held my peace, forbearing to puniſh thee, and was patient towards thee, while thou ranneſt on in all manner of ſinnes; thus patient, and thus forbearing was the Lord toward Cain that wicked reprobate, who as the Text ſaith in 1 John 3.1. <hi>Was of that evil one the Devil, that ſlew his brother,</hi> yet he having done this vile act and villanie in ſhedding of innocent bloud, the Lord was patient with him, and ſuffered him ſtill to live, the Lord ſuffered him to grow rich and wealthie to beget children, and to be the father of a great Nation; thus patient was the Lord with him, and thus patient was the Lord with Saul, to Judas, to Herod, though they were branded and marked for Reprobates, the Lord ſuffered them to live a long time, and as we have it in Acts 14.16. ſaith the Lord, he ſuffered the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to walke in their own wayes, and that for many thouſand yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and yet the Lord was patient with them in their groſſe idolatrie, and did ſuffer them many thouſand yeares to continue in their ſinnes, and in Acts 13.18.

Of whom the Text ſaith in 1 Kings 16.30.

And ſecondly, the perſons unto whom, and that is the Elect, who are deſcribed to be veſſels of mercy, and thoſe prepared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glory; <hi>And that he might declare the riches of his glory unto the veſſels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which he hath prepared unto glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now come we to the opening of the words,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And that he might declare]</hi> Or in like ſort, that he might make known to all the world, men, and Angels, the riches of his glory. The word, <hi>glory,</hi> here, ſignifieth that whereby God is glorious, in particular, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the glory of the grace and mercy of <hi>God;</hi> whereby <hi>God</hi> ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be moſt glorious: and hence it is the Apoſtle putteth glory as an Epithet of <hi>Gods</hi> grace, in Epheſ. 1.6. <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his grace;</hi> and thus the word <hi>glory,</hi> is uſed, in Epheſ. 3.16. <hi>That he might grant you accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the riches of his glory,</hi> what is that? the riches of his grace, and of his mercy; and the word <hi>riches,</hi> (as it doth often in Scripture,) ſignifieth plenty, and abundance; as the Apoſtle calleth it, <hi>the bountifulneſſe of God,</hi> Rom. 2.4. the ſuperabundant bountifulneſſe of God; ſo that his meaning is, that he might declare his abundant grace and mercy upon the veſſels of mercy: veſſels of mercy are here oppoſed unto veſſels of wrath, ſpoken of in the verſe before, and thereby we are to underſtand <hi>Gods</hi> Elect, who are called <hi>veſſels of mercy,</hi> becauſe they are created of <hi>God,</hi> fit to receive mercy, even as veſſels are fit to receive water by reaſon of their concavity, ſo they are veſſels of mercy prepared unto glory, that is, which the Lord hath from everlaſting ordained, and fore-appointed to everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and glory in heaven, 1 Theſſ. 5.9. <hi>God hath not appointed us unto wrath, but he hath appointed us to obtain ſalvation by the meanes of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then thus conceive we the meaning of the Apoſtle; as if he had ſaid,</p>
               <p>And in like ſort that God might make it known to all the world, both to men and Angels, his exceeding great and abundant grace and mercy toward, and upon his Elect, who are veſſels as capable of mercy, as any veſſel to receive water, the Lord having from everlaſting ordained and appointed them to the Kingdom of glory.</p>
               <p>Now the words being thus underſtood, I will onely point at one thing briefly: We ſee here the Apoſtle maketh it apparent, and known, that God ſheweth his Juſtice, and maketh his power known upon the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; thereby to amplifie, and to ſet forth the greatneſſe of his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his choſen, and make known the riches of his mercy upon the veſſels of mercy; This is the ground of the Obſervation. And the Doctrine hence ariſing is this, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  </label> That Gods mercy vouchſafed to his Children in any kind whatſoever, whether concerning ſoul, or body, it appeareth the greater, and is felt the ſweeter, by conſidering Gods wrath and puniſhment in the ſame kind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:108302:101"/> upon the wicked: The riches and the greatneſſe of Gods mercy toward any of his children, is more evident, more apparent, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and the better diſcerned, by comparing it with his juſt puniſhing hand, that he layeth upon others. And to this purpoſe we have many evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Scripture, the mercy of God in ſaving Noah and his Family in the Ark; when the flood was upon the earth; being conſidered with the Lords wrath and vengeance upon the whole world beſides; it made the mercy of God to be more conſpicuous; and better diſcerned of Noah. So the freedome that the people of Iſrael had in the Land of Goſhen, in Egypt, from the plagues of Egypt, when the heavy hand of God was upon the Egyptians, being conſidered with thoſe heavy plagues, did exceedingly ſet forth the riches of Gods mercy to his Children, that they ſhould be ſaved, and the other puniſhed in the ſame land; and in Exod. 14.30, 31. the Text ſaith of the Iſraelites, they ſaw the Egyptians dead upon the bank, and ſaw their final overthrow; and no doubt that Gods Juſtice in their overthrow made the mercy of the Lord in their deliverance appear the better, and thereupon they were ſtirred up to praiſe God after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner, for an extraordinary bleſſing, in the 15. Chapter. And to theſe places I might adde many more, all expreſſing, that the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God vouchſafed to his Children, feeleth ſweeter, and the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable; Conſidered together with Gods wrath in puniſhing the wicked and reprobate; yea it doth raviſh the ſoul of a Child of God, and maketh it more comfortable.</p>

               <p>And for the Application, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Now beloved, if ſo be we deſire to be further enformed touching this, what ſhall make men and Angels to admire the wonderful mercy of God to his Choſen: Beloved, it ſhall be not onely in reſpect of the abundant greatneſſe of Gods mercy to his Choſen, but alſo in reſpect of the freeneſs of Gods grace, and of Gods glory, that God beſtoweth abundance of grace and of mercy and that freely; for when as the wicked and reprobates ſhall at that day have juſtly (according as they have deſerved) inflicted upon them, even everlaſting wrath and vengeance, ſo on the other ſide God hath revealed the greatneſſe of his mercy upon his choſen, not for any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,

                  <p>Again, will <hi>God</hi> one day manifeſt his abundant mercie unto his Choſen <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Now this is to be remembred, and to be thought upon for our comfort that are <hi>Gods</hi> Children in reſpect of this cenſure, that howſoever the grace and the mercie of <hi>God</hi> be obſcured, and they cannot ſee it, yet comfort thy ſelf, the time ſhall come that <hi>God</hi>-wil make it appear to men and Angels, that he is a gracious God, and that he is rich in mercy unto them, and that the love of God is ſpread abroad in thy heart; yea the time ſhal come that men and Angels ſhal ſe thee Crowned with a Crown of glorie, and a Crown of mercie, that they ſhalbe driven to an admiration of it, and then they ſhal befool themſelves, and ſay, we fools thought theſe mens lives to to be madneſs, yea we accounted them contemptible and baſe fellows; but now behold the riches of Gods mercie, that he is wonderfully gracious and merciful unto his Children, they ſhal befool themſelves to ſee the greatneſs of Gods mercie unto his Choſen, which ſhal be ſo great that they ſhal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at it, yea the verie Angels ſhal wonder at it; Angels that are able to underſtand more then all the men in the world, they ſhalbe amazed and wonder at the riches of Gods mercie unto his choſen.

                     </label> That God in ſhewing of mercie unto his Choſen intendeth the glory of his grace, and the glorie of his mercie. The Lord in ſhewing of mercie unto his Choſen doth it to this end, that he might have his praiſe and glorie by it, he aimeth at this end, that it might be known, and admired and ſpoken of and magnified, and that he might have glorie by it, as good Kings and Princes, next after the things that concern Religion, they doe eſteem this above all the honour of their name, that they might be reſpected of their Subjects for their Clemencie and bountie unto their Subjects; ſo it is with the Lord the great King of Heaven and Earth, all the graces and favour, and mercy that he vouchſafeth unto his Choſen, from the firſt mercie, to the laſt; from their Election, to their glorification; in Heaven it tendeth to this end, that his grace and mercy unto his Choſen may be manifeſted and appear, and that he may have the praiſe, and the glorie of his grace, and of his mercie. In Epheſians 1.5. <hi>God</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He hath Predeſtinated us to be Adopted through Jeſus Chriſt in himſelf, (nothing moving him thereunto out of his own bleſſed Majeſtie) according to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Will;</hi> to what end? <hi>To the praiſe of the glory of his grace, of his rich and abundant grace and mercie.</hi> And as glorifying of the riches of his grace and mercy is that which the Lord delighteth in, ſo he aimeth at it as the ſupream and higheſt end in ſhewing of mercy: And the Lord may ſafely ſeek his own glory and praiſe without any danger of pride in it, as it is in
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:108302:103"/> man, for they looking at their own praiſe and eſtimation among men; they are tainted with pride, but it is not ſo with the Lord, becauſe indeed he is the higheſt, and there is none above him. And hence it was in Exod. 34.6, 7. when the Lord ſhewed himſelf unto Moſes, he magnified his mercy above all other attributes, and he proclaimeth his mercy by many ſeveral titles and paſſages, <hi>The Lord, the Lord, ſtrong, merciful and gracious, ſlow to anger, abundant in goodneſſe, and in truth, reſerving mercy unto thouſands, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving iniquities, tranſgreſſions and ſins:</hi> there is mention of Gods power in a word very ſparingly; but there is nothing ſufficient to extol the glory of his mercy, explicating that in variety of expreſſions, and ſetting it out to the full.</p>
                  <p>Now this being a truth, firſt of all this ſerveth to ſtir us up to give God <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> the praiſe and glory of his mercy vouchſafed unto us in any kind whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; this is the main thing the Lord aymeth at, in ſhewing of mercy unto his choſen, that it might be known and glorified. Oh then ſurely we ought never to let the grace, and the mercy of <hi>God</hi> to be out of our mouthes, this is that he delighteth in; and therefore we muſt have his mercy in our mouthes, eſpecially we profeſſing our ſelves to be his children and ſervants; for conſider, I beſeech you, how will thoſe ſervants that belong and apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to bountiful Lords and Maſters, how will they be ever ſetting forth and extolling the bounty, and beneficence of their Maſters in what company ſoever they are, commending their frank Houſe-keeping, and good hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, in being beneficial to the poor, and good to their followers. And ſo indeed they are not the children of God, that do not thus magnifie the riches of <hi>Gods</hi> mercy unto them, and have them in their hearts and mouthes continually, crying out, Oh the mercy of <hi>God</hi> to us is large; elſe they are baſtards, and not the children of <hi>God,</hi> for ſuch as belong unto <hi>Gods</hi> grace, <hi>God</hi> giveth them grace unto this end, that his grace and mercy might be known and magnified, that they may ſay, Oh what hath <hi>God</hi> done for my ſoul; this is the practiſe of a holy ſervant of <hi>God;</hi> therefore we are to be ſtirred up for any mercy the Lord hath vouchſafed in any kind, not onely for health reſtored, or for any ſuch things that are temporal, but alſo for things that are ſpiritual; or for any mercy that he hath beſtowed upon us, we are to be thankful, and eſpecially we are to give praiſe and thanks unto <hi>God,</hi> for his great and wonderful mercy beſtowed upon us in Chriſt Jeſus, in that he gave Chriſt Jeſus to be a Saviour for our ſoules; this we ought to be thankful unto <hi>God</hi> for above all other mercies.</p>
                  <p>Again, is this ſo, that Gods ſhewing of mercy unto his choſen, it tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> to the glory of his mercy? ſurely then it cannot be, that life and glory is given unto Gods choſen, from the hand of Juſtice, as a thing due unto them by their meritorious deſerts, this cannot poſſibly be; for mercy is given for the magnifying of his mercy; for if it were ſo (as the Papiſts teach) given for their merit by the hand of Juſtice, ſurely then God ſhould aym at his Juſtice, as the main and higheſt end of all in their glorification, which is not ſo, for he aymeth at the glory of his mercy; for indeed, as God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth, and aymeth at the glory of his Juſtice and power, as the higheſt end in the deſtruction of the Reprobate and wicked, and ſo he aymeth at the glorification of his mercy, as the higheſt end in the ſalvation of the Elect and godly. And whereas the Papiſts ſay, that life and glory is given as an act of mercy, and of Juſtice, and ſo they would make a hotch-potch, and a compound of that which cannot be compounded; for it is as poſſible that <hi>God</hi> ſhould ſend a man to hell, and condemn a man, out of his revenging Juſtice, and ſaving mercy, at the ſame time; as that <hi>God</hi> ſhould give a man mercy and ſalvation out of his hand of Juſtice, and of mercy: it is as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that <hi>God</hi> ſhould be merciful to a man that he ſendeth to hell; as to be juſt to a man that he giveth ſalvation unto, theſe two can never ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, revenging Juſtice, and ſaving mercy; for the Lord vouchſafeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:108302:104"/> that his mercy may be glorified, and not his juſtice; ſo that mercy cometh not from the hand of Juſtice, but of mercy.</p>
                  <p>Again, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>God</hi> declareth the riches of his mercy to the Elect; hence I might note; That <hi>Gods</hi> grace and mercy vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed unto his choſen, it is full and perfect, fulneſſe of mercy, and perfect mercy; when <hi>God</hi> forgiveth the ſins of his choſen, he forgiveth them not in part, or by the halves, as the Papiſts teach, that <hi>God</hi> forgiveth the ſinnes of his choſen, in reſpect of the eternal puniſhment, but he leaveth the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhment for them to do penance for in the time of Lent: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>God</hi> doth give unto his children full and perfect remiſſion, full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Juſtification, full and perfect glorification, Heb. 7.25. <hi>He is able per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to ſave all that come unto him,</hi> ſaith the Author to the Hebrewes; not to give a half ſalvation, but a full ſalvation; but to paſſe from that.</p>
                  <p>And in the laſt place obſerve we, that the Apoſtle affirmeth it of Gods choſen, that they are veſſels of mercy prepared unto glory, that is, God in his eternal decree hath ordained them to everlaſting glory: ſo that hence I might ſhew, that ſome particular perſons amongſt men are appointed of God to ſalvation in heaven; but that I have often met withal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſſe by it: but hence we may truly take up this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>

But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Papiſts further reply, Chriſt hath merited that the good works of his Choſen, ſhould be meritorious to life and ſalvation; A mere idle ſhift; we find in the Book of God, that Chriſt hath merited for his choſen, and died for their ſins, but we never find he died for their good works, to make them meritorious; no, it is a thing altogether impoſſible; that the beſt works of Gods choſen ſhould have in them the true and whole nature of merit, becauſe they be imperfect, and they are ſtained with ſin; the beſt work that a man can do, when he hath ſtriven to do his beſt, he muſt go to God to crave pardon for his imbecility; now theſe two cannot poſſibly ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to ſtand in need of mercy, and yet be meritorious.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> God, and ſavour it to our deſtruction, and hereupon do as many do, caſt off all care of good works, becauſe they do not merit; yet it is our duty to ſhew unto God our thankfulneſſe for his mercy unto us, in giving us right and title to heaven, and to expreſſe our thankfulneſſe unto him in all holy obedience; yea without queſtion we are bound to thankfulneſſe for exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and temporal good things; becauſe we find that the uſe and comfort of it cometh from God: Oh much more are we then to be thankful unto God for heaven, and in giving us hope of inheritance in heaven.</p>
                  <p>And now becauſe every one will be ready to ſooth up himſelf, and to ſay, I hope I ſhall come to heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I am thankful for it; every one will ſay ſo, we are therefore to look unto it, that we be thankful unto him indeed: how ſhall we know that? we may know it by this, if ſo be we find that we are truly thankful unto God for his mercy unto us in outward good things: and thereby we are moved to walk humbly before the Lord; and the more the Lord openeth his hand, and giveth good things unto us, the more we do prove thankful unto him, and walk before him humbly, Mich. 6.8. and then we may aſſure our ſelves we are truly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But on the contrary part, if ſo be we find that we are not thankfull unto <hi>God</hi> for the things of this life, but (after the manner of the world) the more the Lord doth open his hand unto us, and give them riches, the more they increaſe in pride, in vanity, in ſcorn, in diſdain and contempt of others, becauſe we are richer then others, therefore we will be prouder then others, and diſdain and ſcorn our brethren; let us pretend what we will, we can never make it good, that we are thankful unto God, as David, in 2 Sam. 7.18. conſidering the mercy of God in advancing him to the Kingdom, ſaith, <hi>O what am I, that the Lord ſhould vouchſafe ſuch a mercy unto me?</hi> ſo where that ſpirit is that was in David, it will cauſe thee to be thankful unto God for every bit of bread, and not to be proud and ſcornful, conſidering it cometh from the free mercy of God; ſo that this doctrine is not a doctrine of liberty, but it is a ſpecial means of thankfulneſſe, to ſtirre us up to be truly thankful unto God.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Apoſtle in this Verſe entreth upon the third and laſt part of this Chapter; and the ſum and ſubſtance of this part is a declaration of that great work of calling the Gentiles, and refuſing and rejecting the Jewes, which was foretold by the Prophets; and this from the 24 verſe, to the end of the Chapter: and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle falleth upon this matter, upon occaſion of that which he put down in the Verſe foregoing, that the veſſels of mercy are prepared of God unto glory; now he deſcendeth from the general, to the particular; and that which he had before ſpoken in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the general, he applyeth in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the particular; and he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who they are, that he had ordained to mercy, and they are <hi>the called of God,</hi> the elect of God, calling being an effect of Gods predeſtination, and a fruit and effect of Gods eternal election: and the Apoſtle doth appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate this to the particulars, <hi>Even us whom he hath called;</hi> and he reduceth it to the ſubjects of it, Jewes and Gentiles, and he putteth down that diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution touching the ſubjects of Gods calling, not barely, but (if you mark it) very cautelouſly, and very warily, that his diſtribution might be free from all manner of exception, for he ſaith, not us whom he hath called, Jewes, and Gentiles, but even us whom he hath called, not of the Jewes onely, but alſo of the Gentiles: and now becauſe Gods calling of the Gentiles, it was a thing odious and hateful to the Jewes, a thing ſeeming very abſurd and incredible; the calling of ſuch as were dogs, and without, therefore the Apoſtle dwelleth upon this point, and confirmeth it by a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teſtimony out of the Prophet Hoſea, in the 25. and 26. verſes; and then after this the Apoſtle doth further amplifie the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, by an <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> by the rejection of the Jewes, and that not of the body of the Jewes, but a remnant of the Jewes onely; and this our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle alſo confirmeth by a double Teſtimony out of the Prophet Iſaiah, in the 27, 28, and 29. verſes. And laſt of all, the Apoſtle maketh a Collection, and he putteth it down by way of Anſwer to an Objection that might be made touching the calling of the Gentiles, and rejection of the Jewes, from the 30. verſe, to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>Now then to come to the particular handling of the 24. verſe. In this verſe for the general matter contained in it, we may obſerve two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, an inſtance given by the Apoſtle, touching the perſons that are veſſels of mercy prepared of God unto glory, he inſtanceth in himſelf, and others, <hi>who are called, even us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſecondly, a diſtribution of the ſubjects of this calling, Jewes and Gentiles, the Apoſtle ranging the ſubjects of Gods calling into theſe two ſorts, Jewes, and Gentiles, and he putteth it down ſo warily, and ſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telouſly, that no Objection might be made againſt it, <hi>not of the Jewes onely, but alſo of the Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no great difficulty in the words, <hi>Even us whom he hath called]</hi> Or, according to the text Original, <hi>thoſe whom he hath called, namely us,</hi> whom he hath called, that is, whom God hath called; now Gods calling it is an act of his eternal love, whereby he doth pleaſe to call and invite men to ſalvation, this is the definition of Gods calling in the notion and genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: For when men are called by the preaching of the Word, and the Miniſtry thereof, and they hear it onely with the ears of their body, that is, the external and outward calling, they are called to come to hear and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:108302:105"/> obey, and they hear it, and anſwer not as Chriſt ſpeaketh, Matth. 16.20. <hi>many are called, but few are choſen;</hi> or elſe Gods calling is inward, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, namely this, when men are called by the voyce of God, and the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of it, and they anſwer to it, their hearts anſwer, they are called effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually by the working of the holy Spirit, which bringeth them from Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and unbelief to true knowledge and faith in Chriſt, and they are called out of darkneſſe into a marvellous light, 1 Pet. 2.9. the holy Spirit of God doth bend their hearts to yeeld to the call of the Lord, to receive the promiſe of mercy offered unto them, and he doth cauſe them to yeeld to the will of God revealed in their hearts and lives; this is Gods effectual calling, and this is the calling here meant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>not of the Jewes onely,]</hi> That is, not thoſe onely who are deſcended of the line of Abraham, of Jacob, and of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>but of the Gentiles alſo.]</hi> Which was indeed a hard thing for the Jewes to believe, that is, even us, who are deſcended of another line, and come of another nation of the world, and are termed Gentiles, and are <hi>aliens from the Common wealth of Iſrael,</hi> even us who are ſtrangers from God, Epheſ. 1.12. ſo that we may eaſily conceive the purpoſe of the Apoſtle here to be this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even us whom <hi>God</hi> hath called effectually, and by the work of his Spirit brought from ignorance and unbelief, even us whom he hath wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the preaching of his Word, and made it effectual for our calling to believe in him, even us, not onely us who have deſcended according to the line, and from the loynes of Abraham, and of Jacob, but us whoſoever we be that have come of other Nations and People of the World, and are called Gentiles, and aliens, and ſtrangers, even us hath he called.</p>
               <p>Now then come we to ſuch things as hence are offered unto us for our Inſtruction: And beloved, it is worth our marking (in the firſt place) that the Apoſtle putteth himſelf in the number of thoſe that are called of <hi>God,</hi> and doth aver himſelf to be a veſſel of mercie whom God hath called, even us; you, and I, We that are effectually called, are the veſſels of mercie. I as well as you, and you as well as I are in that number; Now then from hence it followeth directly.</p>
               <p>That the Apoſtle Paul was aſſured of his own ſalvation, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                  </label> and he knew it that he in particular was one of Gods choſen, and that God had appointed him to life and glorie in Heaven, and that he ſhould come to be partaker of it; how? By his true, inward and effectual calling he knew it, and was aſſured of it that he was a veſſel of mercie, and that he was in the number of <hi>Gods</hi> Choſen, and ſhould one day come to eternal ſalvation in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Admit this and grant it to be true, which the enemies of Gods Truth do contend about, that he had a ſpecial and Divine Revelation from Heaven, which declared to him that he was a choſen veſſel, yet he knew it not by ſpecial Revelation onely but alſo by his effectual calling here affirmed: This Text is clear; but he knew it alſo by his effectual calling, and his effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling was an evidence that Heaven was prepared for him, and he prepared for Heaven; ſo that this is clear vnleſs they wil denie the evidence of the text.</p>
               <p>And as this bleſſed Apoſtle was aſſured of his own ſalvation by his effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling, ſo doubtleſs they that are true Chriſtians, that are effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, they come to have a particular aſſurance of their own ſalvation that they are in the number of Gods Choſen; for the Apoſtle (if you mark it) doth joyn others with himſelf; he doth not only ſay, I, but you alſo, ſpeaking in the judgement of Charitie; therefore we are to abhor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that ſame damnable Doctrine of the Church of Rome. who teach, that a particular perſwaſion of a mans own ſalvation is preſumption, it is an illuſion and deceit of the devil, and (ſay they) you mock the people, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:108302:106"/> are blind leaders; but this is a damnable doctrine of theirs: for beloved, take away all aſſurance of a mans ſalvation, and you leave a Chriſtian in a miſerable caſe, we ſtrip him of all ground of joy, and true comfort and rejoycing, yea we take from him all ground of hearty thankfulneſſe, and encouragements of going on in a good courſe of life; for how can a man truly and ſoundly rejoyce in the apprehenſion of the joyes of heaven, when he is uncertain altogether whether he ſhall enjoy them yea or no; how can a man be thankful for that thing that he is altogether uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhall enjoy it, yea or no? And how can a man go on conſtantly in a holy and good courſe of life, when he cannot tell whether it will bring him to heaven, or to hell, yea, or no? as the Papiſts Doctrine doth ſay, Oh it is a moſt uncomfortable poſition, a poſition of Deſperation that thoſe enemies of Gods grace do hold and teach, that a ſpecial perſwaſion of Gods mercy, and of a mans ſalvation, it is preſumption, and a falſe illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the devil; for this is a Poſition directly contrary to the evidence of this Text.</p>
               <p>Again, we ſee that the Apoſtle having ſpoken of Gods veſſels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that they are ſuch as are prepared unto glory, he doth adjoyn a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſtance, who they are that are prepared unto glory, even ſuch as are called of God, I, and you, that are effectually called: hence ariſeth this Concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  </label> That Gods effectual calling is unto men, a ſure and certaine evidence of their election, ſuch as are effectually called amongſt men, and powerfully wrought upon by the preaching of the Word, and brought from their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and unbelief and ſet out of the eſtate of Nature into the ſtate of grace, they have hereby an infallible evidence that they are ſuch as ſhall be ſaved eternally; and this truth we finde made good unto us in many places of Scripture, in Romans 8.30. <hi>VVhom he Predeſtinated, them alſo he called;</hi> where we ſee Gods effectual calling it is a fruit following neceſſarily upon Gods Predeſtination as the effect the cauſe, in Acts 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal Life believed;</hi> they that belonged to Election, they were wrought upon effectually to believe in Chriſt and the Goſpel, and through their Faith and effectual Calling, they were made known to be ſuch as were appointed to life and glorie in Heaven, in John 10.16. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Other ſheep I have that are not of this fold;</hi> they alſo muſt be called, and they ſhall anſwer my calling and voice, and be effectually to their Calling, and ſhall know of what fold they are of, they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my mark, and know my voice, and anſwer my call in 2 Theſſ. 2.13. The Apoſtle having ſaid, <hi>That the believing Theſſalonians were from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning choſen to ſalvation,</hi> he preſently ſubjoyneth in the 14. verſe. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he hath called you by the preaching of his Goſpel, that you might obtain ſalvation, thereby ſignifying that their effectual calling was an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their election, and to theſe many more might be added, all proving that effectual Calling is a certain evidence of Election, and it muſt needs be ſo for this Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Becauſe God in time doth call all thoſe whom he hath before all time from everlaſting, fore-ordained, and ſet apart to life and glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and therefore effectual calling it is proper and peculiar onely unto Gods Elect, others are called outwardly, but Gods effectual calling is proper and peculiar to Gods Childeren, and all thoſe ſhall in Gods due time be effectually called that are appointed to ſalvation in Heaven; ſo that it followeth neceſſarily, that Gods effectual Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is unto men a ſure evidence of Gods Election of them unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Now this point is of excellent uſe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe: </seg>
                  </label> in the firſt place it maketh known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us how we may come to be aſſured of our own ſalvation, and that, that we in particular are in the number of Gods Choſen and ſuch as ſhal be
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:108302:106"/> ſaved, a matter of great weight, and a thing indeed wherein many do erre and goe aſtray in this one point: as thoſe are ſtrongly deluded by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who thinke, (as many doe) that if men doe live a civil and orderly life, (whatſover they be, though they be Papiſts, Familiſts, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, or whatſoever) yet if they leade a Civil and orderly life and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in the World, they ſhall certainly be ſaved; but theſe are deceived; for it is not a Civil and orderly living in the World, (as Conſcience doth enlighten them) that will bring to Life and Salvation; no Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, or Anabaptiſt, can have any aſſurance that they ſhall have Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But if we would have aſſured Evidence, (that cannot deceive us) we muſt ſeek for the proofe of it in our hearts and ſoules, in our effectual Calling, ſee here what evidence of grace we have, then we need not in this caſe to climbe up unto Heaven, to ſearch the Court-Rols of Heaven; but we may take a ſhorter cut, looke into thy owne Charter drawne out with the bloud of Chriſt in thy heart, and therein looke to Gods effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Calling; to the Evidence of grace in thine own ſoul, and that wil Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thee of thy Election, and that thou art in the number of thoſe that are Gods Choſen and herein I deſire that everie one wil deale truely with his owne heart and ſoul.</p>
               <p>Haſte thou anſwered the voyce of God? God calleth upon thee in his Word, to come out of thy Ignorance and thy unbeliefe, and other known ſinnes, tel me, and deale faithfully, Art thou wrought upon by the Word of God? Doeſt thou come out of thy ignorance, and thy blindeneſſe of minde? by a through change from evil to good, is the courſe of thy ſinnes broken off? thy pride, thy drunkenneſſe, thy uſurie.

Doeſt thou finde ſweetneſſe in the Conſolations of the Word of God, and doeſt thou yield obedience to it in all things; in one thing, as well as in another? Not onely in ſome things, but in all things that God requireth? yea, in thoſe things that doe moſt of all croſſe thy owne humour? Doeſt thou finde that the luſts of thy owne heart are curbed and ordered, and doeſt thot finde that thou art now brought to love God, to love his Children, to love his Meſſengers, to love the inſtrument of thy Calling? If thou haſt theſe things in thee, thou art effectually called; and being effectually called, thou art a man or a woman, that ſhall certainly be ſaved; my ſoule for thine, thou ſhalt come to Heaven, all the Devils in Hell cannot deprive thee of it.

And indeed it is the very office of the Spirit of God to teach Gods Children to know the things of God; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle expreſly, 1 Cor. 2.12. <hi>We,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>have not received the ſpirit of the world, but we have received the Spirit of God, whereby we know the good things that are given us of God;</hi> He teacheth us to know our Hope, our Faith, and a good life, it is the office of the Spirit, and he will certainly perform his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                  <p>And beloved, did not the Apoſtle know on whom he had believed, 1.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe two Verſes our Apoſtle proveth the calling of the Gentiles into the eſtate of grace and ſalvation, and that by the Teſtimony of the Prophet Hoſeah; by his predictions, and foretellings of their calling many years before; and becauſe the calling of the Gentiles was a thing harſh and hard to the Jewes; they could not endure to hear of it; what? dogs, baſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called? as you may ſee in Act. 11.28. The text ſaith, that they of the Circumciſion, the Jewes, wrangled with the Apoſtle; and were angry, becauſe he went to the Gentiles, to Dogs, therefore the Apoſtle taketh the more pains, and confirmeth it by a double Teſtimony of the Prophet, though with ſome alteration of the words; The Apoſtle ſetting that in the laſt place; which is in the firſt place. The firſt Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is out of Hoſea 2.23. and the ſecond Teſtimony out of Hoſea 1.10. and he doth alter the words of the Prophet, both for brevity ſake, and the better to fit his purpoſe, and yet the Apoſtle keepeth the ſence of the Prophet entire and whole, without any alteration or change. And the general matter of the Apoſtle citing theſe two Teſtimonies, in this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that that which he had ſaid, was nothing elſe but that which God himſelf had ſpoken by his Prophet Hoſea, ſhould come to paſſe, recorded in holy Writ, (as he ſaith alſo) I have ſhewed you God calleth ſome among the Gentiles; and what is that a new invention? no ſuch matter, <hi>He alſo ſaith it in Hoſea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in theſe words in this 25. and 26. verſes, we may obſerve two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral things.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, a bringing in of the Lord ſpeaking a ſpeech; being recorded by the holy Prophet, and cited by the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the words that the Lord uttered, <hi>I will call them my people, which were not my people,</hi> &amp;c.) And in theſe words thus uttered, we may obſeve a double deſcription of the Gentiles, for of them the Apoſtle and Prophet ſpeaketh; firſt, a deſcribing of them by their eſtate before their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they were then not beloved, not pitied; and ſecondly, a deſcription of their eſtate after their calling, then they were the people of God, the beloved, his Children: a great alteration, from no people, to be a people; from not beloved, to be beloved; from no children, to be children; and this their eſtate is amplified by three things, Firſt, by the free mercy of God toward them, in their calling. Secondly, by the place where it is ſaid, <hi>they are not my people.</hi> Thirdly, their excellent dignity being called, they ſhall be ſtyled, <hi>the children of the living God;</hi> which epithet and title is given, to diſtinguiſh him from the Heathen gods, who were dead and dumb Idols.</p>
               <p>Now come we to the Expoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As he ſaith alſo]</hi> You may eaſily conceive the perſon here meant to be God, <hi>As God ſaith alſo;</hi> the word <hi>alſo,</hi> is not a word that is idly, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluouſly put down, but a word of ſpecial force, and great emphaſis; as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, That which I ſay of the Gentiles, it is no fained thing, but it is the ſame thing that the Prophet hath ſpoken, and that the Lord himſelf delivered to his Prophet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will call them my people, which were not my people, and her beloved, which was not beloved.]</hi> Theſe are the words of the Prophet here cited by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and here is a difficulty to be unfolded; for he maketh here his appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:108302:109"/> to the Gentiles: But if you look in Hoſea 1.10. &amp; the 2.23. you ſhall find them ſpoken directly to the Jewes, for their comfort, after their diſperſing and ſcattering abroad, they ſhould be called again; ſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text doth plainly expreſſe to the Comfort of the Jewes, how then can the Apoſtle apply theſe words to the calling of the Gentiles? for the clearing of this doubt, we muſt conſider, that the Apoſtle Paul had the infallible aſſiſtance and guidance of the Spirit of God, he did what he did by the guiding of the Spirit, ſo that he could not erre, either in his allegation; or application of Scripture.</p>
               <p>And again, though this be directed to the Jewes that were now ſcattered abroad for their ſins, and telleth them to their comfort, that the time ſhall come, when they ſhall be gathered together again, and that the Lord would reſtore the Elect among the Jewes, (meaning ſpiritually, by the preaching, voyce, and call of the Goſpel,) in the Kingdome of the Meſſiah; though this be directed to the Jewes, yet under theſe termes are alſo the Gentiles ſignified and underſtood; and indeed the Gentiles were properly not the people of God, it was never properly ſpoken to the Jewes, but to the Gentiles; (they were not the people of God properly,) ſo that theſe words are properly ſpoken to the Gentiles, and accidentally to the Jewes, by reaſon of their impiety and Idolatry. And we ſhall find it a marvellous uſual thing, that when the Prophets do ſpeak of the defection of the Jews, and their dejection and falling from God, then they make a tranſition, a paſſage from that to the Kingdome of the Meſſiah. And they promiſe; that under the coming of the Meſſiah, a greater number of the people ſhould be aggregated and joyned to the Jewes, and ſo concopulated, and made one body, Epheſ. 2.16. <hi>Now you are made one body through Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> God hath made one body, both of the Jewes and Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the Explication, <hi>and I will call them my people, which were not my people, and her beloved which was not beloved.</hi> I will onely deſcant upon theſe words, and the meaning is thus; Thoſe that were ſtrangers from the Covenant of grace, thoſe that were in their natural eſtate and condition; and are none of my people, that have not me for a God and Father to them, even thoſe that were aliens from the Common wealth of Iſrael, theſe will I call effectually, and through the preaching of the Word and Goſpel, bring them to the ſtate of faith and grace in Jeſus Chriſt, and within the compaſſe of my ſpecial love and favour, and mercy, and I will make them to be within the number of my peculiar people, and I will be a living and gracious Father unto them. A paralel place unto this we have in 1 Pet. 2.10. where the Apoſtle ſpeaketh thus, <hi>which in times paſt had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy,</hi> which is an expreſſing of what is meant by being called the people of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in the place where it is ſaid, that they were not my people,]</hi> By <hi>place,</hi> is meant the Countries, the Nations, the Kingdomes of the Gentiles, which were without the pale of Jewry, the Precincts and limits of Canaan; now ſaith the Lord, them will I call alſo my children, even thoſe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, in thoſe places will I cauſe men to know me, to worſhip me, and to fear me, as in Mal. 1. and they ſhall be called and ſtyled by that worthy title the Children of God, the living God, who is the Authour and giver of all life. I will not ſtand to draw them into a narrower compaſſe, for you may eaſily conceive them.</p>
               <p>Come we now to matter of Inſtruction, and firſt of all from theſe words, in the 25. verſe, <hi>As he ſaith alſo,</hi> that is, as <hi>God</hi> ſaith alſo; from hence note we firſt, <label type="milestone">

               <p>That <hi>God</hi> ſpake by his Prophets and Apoſtles. The holy Prophets of <hi>God,</hi> and the holy Apoſtles, they were but <hi>Gods</hi> mouth to deliver his mind and meſſage to his people; they were not the inventers of it, but onely the Writers, Pen-men, and Revealers of it; The text is clear to this purpoſe,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:108302:109"/> 2 Pet. 1.20, 21. The Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>no interpretation of Scripture is of any private invention of man, but prophecie in old time, it came not by the will of man, but by the Holy Ghost, they ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and in Gal. 1.11. <hi>Brethren, the Gospel that I preach, it was not after the manner of men, neither received I it from men, but by the immediate Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt from heaven.</hi> The Prophets and Apoſtles, in the execution of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, it was no invention of man, but it was the holy mind and holy will of <hi>God,</hi> which it pleaſeth him to open unto him, that they might diſpenſe it to his people. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> 
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the words of the Prophets and Apoſtles are ſo to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as the mind and will of <hi>God;</hi> and (to apply this to another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,) the words of the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, they are to be ſpoken of, and to be reverently handled by thoſe that take upon them to handle the words of God, as the word of God, not as mans word, they are to be handled as the Apoſtle ſaith, in 1 Pet. 4.11. <hi>If any man ſpeak, let him speak as the word of God;</hi> if any man in the publick Miniſtry ſpeak the Word of <hi>God,</hi> let him ſee that he ſpeak not onely the word of <hi>God,</hi> but as the word of <hi>God,</hi> which indeed are holy, and pure, and powerful, and are ſo to be ſpoken, and ſo to be uttered, by thoſe that do take upon them to diſpenſe it to <hi>Gods</hi> people; it is not ſufficient for them to utter the bare words, but to utter them with power and authority, and as the Apoſtle ſaith, in 1 Cor. 2.4. they are to be delivered in the demonſtration and evidence of the Spirit of God, yea they are ſo to be handled with ſuch evidence of the Spirit and power, that men may diſcern the power and Majeſtie of it, 1 Cor. 4.25. and may ſay, without queſtion, God is in that Preacher, now the everliving God ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>And do they thus, that do handle the words of the holy Prophets and Apoſtle, looſly, careleſly, and after a carnal manner, in the inticing words of mans wiſdome, in frothy, idle, and ink-horn tearmes, ſuch as are humane eloquence, or thoſe that mingle the holy word of God, and the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; with their own inventions, and their own devices, with the ſayings of ſuch a Poet, ſuch a Philoſopher, do theſe deliver it purely? Jer. 23.28. <hi>He that hath my words, let him ſpeak my words faithfully:</hi> what do thoſe then that come into the Pulpit, and do ſpeak idly, and fooliſhly, and do take the name of God in vain? do theſe ſpeak it in the demonſtration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? No, a Preacher that ſpeaketh unto the people muſt conſider, now am I to ſpeak, not onely <hi>Gods</hi> Word, but <hi>Gods</hi> Word after a holy manner; and if God were here, would God ſpeak thus vainly? thus idly and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, and feed the people with chaffe inſtead of Wheat? they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member they are in the place of God; yea whoſoever they be, that doe draw ſuch Concluſions from the Word of God, that are not there found; though they be ſound and Orthodoxal, if they are not agreeable to the will of <hi>God</hi> in that place, they are not Gods word, but the words of man, howſoever they may ſay, men will not hear the word of God, yet they are not the words of God, though ſound and good, if they be not natural from the place, and ſo by this means the Word of God doth work juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon the hearers; therefore it is no eaſie matter to handle the words of the Prophets and Apoſtles, as they ought to be handled, it requireth great ſtudy, great prayer, great meditation, even watching and ſtriving, ſtudying and praying, to deliver that which is agreeable to the Word: it is an eaſie matter to hear the Word formally, but the hardeſt thing in the world to preach it ſoundly.</p>
               <p>Now obſerve we further from this preface, <hi>As he ſaith alſo,</hi> that is, that which I deliver touching the calling of the Gentiles, it is no ſtrange thing newly invented, but it is the very ſame that God himſelf delivereth and foreſpeaketh long ſince, and now it is fulfilled and accompliſhed,

                  <p>COme we now to the words of the Teſtimonie it ſelfe, in theſe two verſes. And herein the Apoſtle doth invert the Order of the words of the Prophet, putting that which is firſt, laſt; yea the Apoſtle doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alter and change the words of the Prophet, and keepeth not ſtrictly, and preciſely to the very words of the Prophet, citing word for word, yet he keepeth the ſcope, ſenſe and meaning of the Prophet, ſound and intire without any alteration, or change, hence then note we thus much;</p>
                  <p>That it is not alwayes neceſſarie that the very words of the Scripture, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                     </label> ſhould be ſtrictly, orderly and preciſely kept in the preaching of the Word, ſo that the ſence, and ſcope, and meaning of the place be kept ſound and intire without wrong, change, or alteration.</p>
                  <p>The Preachers of the Word muſt look unto it, that they neither deprave nor corrupt the places of Scripture, that they doe not cut them off, and leave out ſomething needful; this was the ſinne of the Devil in Matthew 4.6. <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee,</hi> and leaveth out <hi>(to keep thee in all thy wayes;)</hi> Nor that they doe not wreſt and wring the places of Scripture to a wrong ſence and wrong purpoſe, and make them as a noſe of waxe, and draw them to a wrong purpoſe, and vex the Holy Word of <hi>God,</hi> which is the dealing of all hereticks, and eſpecially ſuch as doe turne the places of Scripture, and the plain Stories of the Bible into Allegories; and ſo wrong the ſence of the Scripture: yet Miniſters of the Word; they may alledge and cite places of Scripture with ſome alteration, ſo they keep the ſence ſafe, ſound and intire, John 7.38. <hi>He that believeth in me,</hi> as ſaith the Scripture, <hi>out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of water.</hi> Where doth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſay ſo? Surely in no place that we finde in the Old Teſtament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>&amp; totidem verbis,</hi> in the very ſame words; yet for the matter and ſubſtance of theſe words they may be collected and gathered out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets, as out of Eſay 44.3. and 49.10. Joel 3.18. in all which places mention is made of pouring water upon the drie and thirſtie ground, and of diving into the Waters of Life, and of a fountain that ſhould iſſue out from the houſe of the Lord. Now the Lord Jeſus doth apply theſe words of the Prophets (having reſpect to Chriſt who is the Fountain of Life, and of all Spiritual graces) he doth apply them to all thoſe that truely believe in him, that though they were drie and barren, yet out of them ſhall flow the rivers of water of Life; ſo that though he doth not ſet down the words of the Prophets expreſly, yet he keepeth the ſence, and meaning of the words.</p>
                  <p>So that it concerneth the Preachers of the Word to be very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſcope and drift of the Scriptures, that howſoever they may miſſe of the words, yet they muſt keep the ſence intire, and ſee that they doe not ſwerve from the intent and purpoſe of the Holy Spirit of God in the Text.</p>
                  <p>And as they muſt be careful that the places of Scripture be fit and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the purpoſe they have in hand, ſo alſo that the places they doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be truely underſtood, and rightly applied according to the meaning of the Word, and then they are the true Word of God, and are a notable means to beate down the ſtrong holds of ſinne, and of Sathan; (to paſs by that.)</p>
                  <p>Come we now to the Teſtimonie it ſelf recorded by the Prophet, and here alledged by the Apoſtle <hi>[I will call them my people which were not my people, and her beloved, which was not beloved.]</hi> Theſe words are a plain Text, and doe evidence unto us the vocation and <hi>calling of the Gentiles,</hi> which was long agoe foretold, and now fulfilled, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are

Oh Lord open the eyes of their underſtanding that they may clearly ſee the riches of his <hi>calling,</hi> and the ſweet comforts of the Goſpel. And hence it was that the Apoſtle ſaith, in 2 Cor. 4.6. That God by the ſame Almightie power, whereby he brought light out of darkneſs, cauſeth them to ſee the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt; yea, the Lord doth afford the outward ſound and preaching of the Word out of his free mercie where it pleaſeth him; He appointeth the drops of rain to fall in this place, and not in that, ſo he doth cauſe the dew of his Word to fall upon the <hi>clay the Gentiles,</hi> in Matth. 10.6. into the Cities of the Samaritans enter not; and in Acts 16.6, 7: we find that Paul and Timothy they were forbidden of the holy Ghoſt to preach the Word in Aſia. Yea, when they had a mind to goe to Bythinia, the Spirit of God would not ſuffer them, but ſent them to Macedonia, Acts 16.9. <hi>Come over into Macedonia and help us;</hi> ſo that the outward preaching of the Word it is vouchſafed to ſome, and not to others, as when Chriſt lived upon the face of the earth, the bodily eyes of all men were not opened, but onely ſome, and others remaine blind, ſome blind perſons were left in their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; And the dead bodies of all were not raiſed, though ſome were, at the death of Chriſt; ſo dealeth the Lord with the minds and ſouls of men, he onely out of his gracious pleaſure doth open the minds of ſome men, and make them to ſee, know, and underſtand and believe by the preaching of the Word, according to his gracious pleaſure; therefore we may reſolve upon it (as a certain truth,) that God doth call men out of the eſtate of nature, into the eſtate of grace effectually out of his free grace and mercy.</p>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:108302:111"/> Chriſt died for all men univerſally without any exception of any. Now not to ſtand upon this erroneous poſition, which is a dangerous errour in the ground of it, it making the ſin of men the ſins of the world; death and hell, to be ſtronger then Chriſt, that Chriſt ſhould die for all men, and yet ſome of thoſe men goe to hell, a fowl and a groſs errour: beſides this, it cannot ſtand with the truth now delivered, that Chriſt died effectually for all men, without exception of any; for if ſo be <hi>Chriſt</hi> did die for all men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and univerſally, then doubtleſs all are acquainted with it, ſavingly as a benefit belonging to themſelves ſuch as are redeemed, aſſuredly <hi>God</hi> doth bring them to the ſaving knowledge of their redemption. Now this is not ſo; the preaching of the Word, and plain experience doth tell the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie; for <hi>God</hi> out of his mere good will and pleaſure doth call none effectually, but ſuch as are redeemed by Chriſt, and ſo all men are not, for then they ſhould ſavingly be brought to the knowledge of their redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but all are not ſo, for as in the time of Chriſt all men that were blinde had not their eyes opened, ſo all have not their minds enlightned, and therefore univerſal redemption wrought by Chriſt is a meer fancie of the brain of man forged in hell, and there is no truth in it; to ſay that Chriſt died for all, and if we reſt upon this; we ſhall finde a deceiving ground of comfort. Howſoever ſome will ſay, how ſhall we comfort a poor ſoul, a priſoner that is to be executed but by telling him Chriſt died for all, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what ground? No Chriſt died not for all.</p>
                  <p>Again, is it ſo that <hi>God</hi> worketh freely upon the minds and ſouls of men out of his free grace and mercy; Oh then ſuch as find themſelves to be in <label type="milestone">

Conſider it thou that haſt good evidence of thy effectual calling that art transformed and changed and brought into a new mold and faſhion; conſider with thy ſelf that many are left in their natural ignorance and unbelief; yea many are given over to Popiſh ſuperſtitions, many living in the ſame place, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame means, hearing the ſame ſermons, ſitting in the ſame ſeat with thee, they remain ignorant in their blindneſſe of minde, and hardneſſe of heart, but <hi>God</hi> hath given thee not onely his Word and Goſpel preached, but a heart enlightned to receive it; therefore thou haſt cauſe to magnifie the mercy of God for this bleſſing of all bleſſings: And learn thou to break out and ſay, <hi>[Lord, what am I, that thou ſhouldeſt vouchſafe unto me ſuch a mercie, I ſee thouſands in their natural eſtate and ignorance, I was born and brought forth in ſinne like other men, and have increaſed and multiplied my ſinnes exceedingly, my unthankefulneſſe is great, and my unworthineſſe greater, and yet thou haſt vouchſafed mercy unto me above many thouſands, Lord thou art gracious and merciful unto me.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we ought to be ſtirred up our ſelves to magnifie the mercie of <hi>God,</hi> in that many thouſands are given to Popiſh ſuperſtition, and <hi>God</hi> hath given thee a flexible heart to his Word: Oh thou canſt not be ſufficiently thankful for ſo great a favour.</p>

                  <p>This truth being thus cleared, firſt of all, it meeteth with the conceit of <label type="milestone">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are now to come to ſtand upon the laſt of theſe two verſes, the 26. verſe, where we ſee the Apoſtle doth double his teſtimony, and doth bring two places both of them to one and the ſame purpoſe; one of them had been ſufficient, but he bringeth two; and indeed doubling of ſpeeches in Scripture is not idle, nor ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, but it is of excellent uſe and purpoſe; it ſerveth both for more certainty, and for more plainneſſe; and perſpicuity, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.32. Joſeph ſaid unto Pharaoh, his dream was dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; and why? becauſe the thing ſhould certainly come to paſſe; ſo likewiſe it maketh things more evident, plain, and perſpicuous, as in Phil. 3.1. The Apoſtle ſaith, It grieveth not me to write unto you the ſame things again, for they are ſure and certain.</p>
                  <p>The point needs not to be inlarged; onely I note it to teach us, that we muſt double our regard and our reſpect of things that are often repeated, and often beaten upon in the holy Scripture; God having a mouth to ſpeak, we muſt have an ear to hear, a mind to attend, and a heart to yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto him; and the Lord doubling his ſpeech, and repeating the ſame things again, we muſt double our hearing, double our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and double our care, to profit by it, and make uſe accordingly. As in particular, Doth the Lord double his threats againſt thy ſins? haſt thou often heard of thy particular ſinnes, thy drunkenneſſe, thy whoredome, thy pride, thy Sabbath-breaking, thy Uſury? haſt thou heard of it again and again? hath the Lord directed his Miniſters, to denounce his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments often againſt thee for thy ſinnes? Oh then it behoveth thee to double thy care and reſpect in reforming of thy ſinnes; hath the Lord of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten threatned thee for thy pride, thy gariſhneſſe in apparel? and is it not amended? certainly the Lord will deal with thee proportionably, thou reſiſteſt the holy Spirit of God, that hath doubled his threatenings againſt thee for thy ſinnes, and thou not amending, but going on, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly one day double his plagues and Judgments upon thee, without refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                  <p>Now touching the matter of the Apoſtles ſpeech, <hi>And it ſhall be in the place where it was ſaid, they are not my people, there they ſhall be called my people:</hi> Here we ſee, the Lord doth ſet forth the Calling of the Gentiles by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the place, the meaning is, as if the Lord had ſaid, In thoſe Nations, thoſe Kingdoms, thoſe Countries of the world, where I have none that do fear, nor worſhip me, nor are called by the name of my people, but are Heathen, and Pagans, there will I raiſe up ſome to call upon me, and to offer unto me. So that we may ſee, that Gods calling of men to the eſtate of grace, it reſpecteth no place, but in any place, in any Countrey of the World, the Lord will call them in due time: but this point for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we have formerly handled. But hence we may gather briefly thus much, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That diſtinction of place, in regard of holineſſe, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                     </label> is now taken away in the time of the New Teſtament, it is now aboliſhed, one place is not now holier then another, but in every nation, in every place, God will have people to worſhip him; neither is the worſhip of God now tyed to one place, more then to another, as if one place were more holier then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Indeed in the time of the Old Teſtament, (as you may ſee in Deut.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:108302:114"/> 16.) there was a place whither the Tribes of Iſrael ſhould reſort three times in a yeare, and come to worſhip <hi>God</hi> publickly in that place, and that was the Cittie of Jeruſalem, Matthew 4.5. Called <hi>Sancta <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbs,</hi> the Holy Cittie, and the whole Land muſt goe to worſtip there. But now in the time of the New Teſtament, all places are alike Holy, and men may offer up a pure Offering to the Name of God in any place; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, in 1 Timothy 2.8. <hi>I will that men lift up pure hands unto God in every place, even pray in every place.</hi> And this was foretold by the Prophet in Zephaniah 2.11. <hi>That in every place men ſhould worſhip the Lord of Hoſts, yea in all the Iles of the Heathen;</hi> and all the Nations of the world not to be tied to Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</p>
                  <p>So then upon this ground appeareth the folly and abſurditie of Popiſh Pilgrimages, and in particular their going a Pilgrimage to the Holy Land of Jude, aand Cittie of Hieruſalem; why? Holineſſe is not inherent in the ground, or in the walls of Hieruſalem, no, Hieruſalem was a Holy Cittie, in regard of the pure and true worſhip of God; but now (that failing, and taken away and given to other people) that is no more holy then other places of the world; therefore it is abſurd for them to go to the Holy Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in Pilgrimage: but to leave them.</p>
                  <p>There be many amongſt our ſelves that are juſtly to be blamed, who either out of their groſſe ignorance, or blind and Popiſh ſuperſtition, aſcribed Holineſſe more to one place then to another, and tie the preſence of <hi>God</hi> more to one certaine place, then to another as in the Church the places of publicke Aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>Oh they think thoſe places are farre holier then other places, and thereupon if they have occaſion to goe through Pauls or other Churches when there is no publick ſervice, yet they drop down upon their knees to a piller, and there poure out their prayers, this is groſſe and blind ſuperſtition; for diſtinction of place is now gone, a man may as well poure out his prayers with Divine thoughts and pure hands, as well in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and in the field, as in the Church.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe, the places, of publick meeting the Churches, are more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for comlineſſe and Orders ſake, for publick worſhip, but they poure out their private prayers in a publick place, out of the time of publicke worſhip; Holyneſſe is not in the place, but in the company and the worſhip there performed, but the place is not holy in the time, nor out of the time of exerciſe, no more then any other place.</p>
                  <p>Again, we ſee further, the Lord here ſetteth out the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to the eſtate of grace, by the excellent dignitie and worthineſſe of it; What are they being called? why, in all places, and in all Nations, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Living God: an excellent dignitie; ſo then the point from hence is this;</p>
                  <p> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                     </label> That it is a matter of great honour, and of excellent dignitie, for men to be called to the eſtate of Gods Children, ſuch as are indeed wrought upon and brought out of the eſtate of Nature, into the eſtate of Grace, and made the Children of God, they are wonderfully dignified; to this purpoſe ſpeaketh the Evangeliſt, John 1.12. <hi>As many as received him,</hi> (meaning Chriſt) <hi>to them he gave power,</hi> (or rather priviledge and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative) <hi>to be the ſonnes of God,</hi> not power ſignifying power and ſtrength of free will to be made Gods Children, as the Rhemiſts note upon that place, but the priviledge, honour and prerogative that they have being the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, there is no ſervice to the ſervice of the King of Heaven, it was as much as the Prodigal deſired, Luke 15.19. <hi>(Father I am not worthie to be called thy ſonne, make me one of thy hired ſervants.)</hi> Yea God hath no need of the ſervice of men, he hath thouſands; yea ten thouſand thouſands of holy and glorious Angels to wait and attend upon him, and to be at his
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:108302:114"/> beck, Daniel 7.10. But for men to be made not onely the ſervants of God, but to be made his Children by Adoption, and Grace, it is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement exceeding great and wonderful; Moſes was a faithful ſervant in the Houſe of God, yet nothing comparable unto Chriſt, who ruled in the Houſe of God as his ſonne, Hebrewes 3.5, 6. What was Abrahams eldeſt ſervant Eleazar, to his youngeſt ſonne? nothing. And what was Joab the ſervant of David, though a man of great place and authoritie, in compariſon of <hi>Solomon</hi> the ſonne of David? No, <hi>Solomon</hi> reckoneth of it as a ſpecial honour, Proverbs 1.1. (<hi>Solomon</hi> the ſonne of David, ſo that it is a greater honour to be the Sonne of God, and it muſt needs bee ſo.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe men who are made the Children of <hi>God,</hi> what are they of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> Baſe and miſerable wretches and ſinneful, yea children of wrath, children of the Devil, and <hi>God</hi> who maketh them his Children, what is he? Surely he is a moſt Holy, Glorious, and higheſt Majeſtie, and according to the Dignitie of the Perſon of the Father, ſo is the honour of the Childe, the Childe of a Prince or Noble man is more reſpected then the Childe of a baſer man, and that worthily; and hence David being moved by his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſervants to become the ſonne in Law of Saul, 1 Samuel 18.23. ſaith, <hi>(Seemeth it a ſmall thing unto you for me to be ſonne in law to a King?)</hi> Did holy David (a man worthily deſerving at the hands of Saul) think it a great matter to enter into aliance with Saul; and ſhall not we think it a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful honor for us that are baſe and vile men, to be made the ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the great God of Heaven and Earth?</p>
                  <p>Men being made the Children of God, they are the heirs of God, every <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> Childe of God is an heire; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle in Romans 8.17. <hi>(If we Children, we are alſo Heires,)</hi> yea they are made joynt-heires and co-heires with the Sonne of God, and they ſhall one day ſhare with him in Life and Glory; Therefore it followeth undeniably, that it is a great honour and dignitie to be a Childe of God, yea a greater honour and dignitie, then if they were advanced to be the heires of the greateſt Monarch in the world.</p>
                  <p>We ſee then upon this ground, the vain and blinde conceit of the world, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> and worldlings touching the happie, and bleſſed eſtate of Gods Children, for they are ſo farre from thinking it is an advancement, that they account it the baſeſt thing in the world to be the Children of God, yea they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them to be moſt vile and contemptible perſons in the world, they judge of them by their outward appearance, they ſee not that grace that lieth hid either under that excellent grace of humilitie, or elſe under a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and afflicted eſtate, and therefore they eſteem baſely of them, but they lift up their conceit in regard of men that are great and mightie in the world; they have cappe and knee and all outward pomp given unto them.</p>
                  <p>Alas, they are blinde and cannot ſee and diſcern their miſerable eſtate; for all the honour that great and mightie men have, it is nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of a Childe of God: No though their excellencie did mount up to Heaven, and touch the skie with their heads, and make their neſts among the Stars, yet being not in the eſtate of grace, they are in a baſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſhall be tumbled down, and trodden down as the dung under their feet; therefore they are deceived that magnifie them, and honour them ſo much.</p>
                  <p>Haſte thou then good evidence that thou art a Childe of God, and in <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> the eſtate of grace? ſurely then know this (to thy comfort) thou art in a moſt excellent and honourable eſtate, though thou be in a mean eſtate, far better then thoſe that lift up themſelves; and cheer up thy ſelf, thou art precious in the ſight of God, Eſay 43.4. <hi>Becauſe thou art precious and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:108302:115"/> in my ſight;</hi> yea, thou art honourable in the ſight of all the holy Angels of God, yea of the Saints of God: And howſoever the world doe ſeek to blemiſh thee, and to caſt dirt in thy face, and ſay thou art a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke, a Puritan, an Hypocrite, yet they cannot poſſibly diſgrace thee; for the honour that is put upon thy head, is put by the hand of God, and it will make thee honourable and glorious in the ſight of men and Angels; Alas the honour of the world conferred upon men, it hath many interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and breakings off, and if it continue as long as they live, yet then it leaveth them, and they leave a rotten and ſtinking name behind them, but the honour conferred upon thee, is holy and heavenly Honour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth after death: Yea conſider, that thou being a Childe of God, thou art the Childe of him that liveth for ever, thy Father never dies; and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly thy Father never dying, there is no end of his dayes and glory; ſo he will make thee glorious alſo, and crown thee with Eternal happineſſe; and therefore thou art an honourable perſon.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe three verſes our Apoſtle affirmeth, and further amplifieth the <hi>vocation and calling of the Gentiles,</hi> by an <hi>Antitheſis;</hi> namely, by the rejection and caſting off of the Jewes, for the body of them, and the greateſt part and number of them; the Lord only <hi>calling</hi> a few, and a remnant, and a ſeed of them. And this our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle confirmeth by two Teſtimonies from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Eſay.</p>
               <p>The firſt as you may reade in Eſay 10.21. &amp; 22. verſe, which is here laid down in the 27. and 28. verſes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Teſtimonie is in Eſay 1.8. and here put down in the 29. verſe; Now in theſe two Teſtimonies tending both to one and the ſame purpoſe, there are in general two things conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all the thing witneſſed, and ſecondly, the amplification of the thing witneſſed: The thing witneſſed is, that a very ſmal number of the people of the Jewes, (in compariſon of the multitude) ſhalbe ſaved, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed under the term <hi>remnant</hi> in the 27. verſe, and <hi>ſeed</hi> in the 29. verſe; and the amplification of the thing witeſſed, is in 5 particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all the perſon witneſſing the Prophet Eſay.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the manner of his giving Teſtimonie, that is, <hi>with crying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the confeſſion of a grant made by the Prophet, (and here ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apoſtle;) That though the number of the Children of Iſrael were exceeding great, (ſet out by a compariſon of the ſand of the Sea) yet <hi>but a remnant ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Reaſon and ground of this, why <hi>but a remnant ſhalbe ſaved,</hi> and that is Gods purpoſe, and Gods will, (which is amplyfied by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of it <hi>in righteouſneſs,</hi> in the 28. verſe.)</p>
               <p>Fifthly, a magnifying of Gods mercy in ſaving <hi>a few,</hi> and <hi>a ſmall number of the people of the Iewes,</hi> which is ſet out by a compariſon taken from <hi>Sodom
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:108302:115"/> and Gomorrah,</hi> and alſo by a Title given unto <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>called the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Thus we ſee the general matter of the Holy Ghoſt in theſe three verſes: Now come we to handle them particularly, and firſt of the 27. and 28. verſes; for theſe verſes are very difficult and hard to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As Eſaias alſo crieth;]</hi> Crying doth import a loud, a plain, a bold, and an earneſt ſpeaking, not an ordinarie ſpeech, but a ſpeaking with an extenſion, and lifting up of the voyce, and he crieth concerning the people of Iſrael, what doth he crie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That though the people of Iſrael were as the ſand on the ſea,]</hi> That is, though they were a numberleſſe multitude; even as ſands upon the Sea ſhore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet but a remnant ſhalbe ſaved;]</hi> The word remnant is taken from trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> who uſe to cut out a whole piece of cloth into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels until a little be left, and that they <hi>call a remnant</hi> or remainder; ſo a remnant, a very ſmal number of the Jewes ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shalbe ſaved,]</hi> Now the Prophet he ſaith, <hi>not a remnant ſhalbe ſaved, but ſhall return,</hi> in Eſay 10.22. meaning hiſtorically they ſhal return from the Captivitie of Babylon, yet we muſt know that the Prophet under the title of return, doth intend a further matter, namely a ſpiritual returning a return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, as he ſaith, in the 21. verſ of that Chapter, <hi>(The remnant of Iacob, to the mightie God ſhal return,)</hi> that is, they ſhal repent of their ſinnes and be ſaved; ſo the Apoſtle and the Prophet do wel agree;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For he will make his account draw near, and bring it to a ſhort ſumme in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.]</hi> Not to trouble you with varietie of Expoſitions, with which this verſe is exceedingly vexed, and doth much puſle Interpreters; but the words of the Prophet Eſayias are theſe, <hi>(The conſumption decreed ſhall overflow with righteouſneſs;)</hi> and here the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>(for he will make his account, and draw it to a ſhort ſumme in righteouſneſſe.)</hi> And for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this, we muſt know, that the thing intended, and ſignified both by the Prophet and Apoſtle is this, as we may eaſily gather from the context; That God hath purpoſed and ordained to bring the ſinneful and unthankful people of the Jewes, to a ſmall number, and a ſhort ſumme, and that juſtly for their unthankfulneſſe and ſinnes, which the Prophet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth in theſe termes: <hi>(The conſumption decreed ſhall overflow with righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,)</hi> becauſe the Prophet knowing that the Lord would bring theſe people to a ſmal number; He decreeth that this conſumption which God hath determined, he will bring upon them for their ſinnes, ſhall overflow them, and they ſhalbe as unable to ſtand againſt them, as a poore thinne weake bridge is unable to ſtand againſt a ſtiffe ſtream, and a ſtrong run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwelling water, it ſhal overthrow them, as a river overflowing the bankes doth bear all things before it. Now the Apoſtle, following the Tranſlation of the Septuagint, with which the Romans were beſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, expreſſeth it in theſe words;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That hc will make vp his account, and draw it to a ſhort ſumme in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;]</hi> that is, <hi>by making account, and drawing it to a ſhort ſumme,</hi> we are to underſtand that the Lord would bring that conſumption which he had decreed, and that ſpeedily, and make a ſhort worke, and a ſhort buſineſſe of the matter; for the word <hi>[Logon]</hi> may as well ſignifie a ſhort work, as a ſhort word, for hee will make a ſhort worke of the buſineſſe: and we are alſo here to conſider the extent of this conſumption, that as it ſhall be ſpeedy and ſwift, and they ſhalbe ſoon waſted, ſo that few of them ſhould be left, that they ſhould be as trees in a grove, which a Childe may tell, Eſay 10.19. <hi>For the Lord will make a ſhort account in the earth;</hi> hereby we are to underſtand, that the Lord would bring this conſumption, and finiſh this work in the very midſt of the earth, in the very bowels, and chiefeſt part of the Kingdome, Eſay
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:108302:116"/> 10.25. Now then thus receive we briefly the meaning of the words of theſe two verſes.</p>
               <p>Eſaias the Prophet, he alſo ſpeaketh plainly and boldly concerning the people of Iſrael in this manner; that though the Number of the Children of Iſrael, were an exceeding great Number, a Numberleſſe Multitude, yet but a few of them ſhould return from the Captivitie of Babilon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God, and repent of their ſinnes, and be ſaved eternally; (for ſo ſaith the Prophet) The Lore he hath purpoſed and decreed, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to bring that ſinneful Nation of the Jewes, to a very ſmall remnant, and Number. Yea, finiſhing the great work of their Conſumption ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and extending it ſo farre, as that a ſmal Number ſhal be left, for the Lord will finiſh his work in the very heart, and midſt and principal part of the Land, thus we are to conceive the meaning of the Prophet ſcited by the Apoſtle; Come we now to inſtructions.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all obſerve we, that the Apoſtle here bringeth in the Prophet Eſayias, ſpeaking not barely of the rejection of the Jewes, but alſo crying of it, ſpeaking with the extenſion of his voice; he ſpeaketh boldly, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to the purpoſe, proclaiming it to the purpoſe; that though their number were never ſo great, even as the ſand upon the Sea ſhore, he would deſtroy them; though doubtleſſe this was a very harſh and unpleaſing meſſage: yea, the delivering of it, was like to bring many about his eares, what Eſaias ſhall few of us be ſaved, yet we ſee the Prophet Eſaias uttereth it boldly without fear or fainting.</p>
               <p>I tell you to your faces, that though your number were as the Sea ſhore, yet but a few of you ſhall be ſaved; ſee how bold and plain the Prophet is in delivering this meſſage ſo harſh and hard: Hence we may obſerve this inſtruction, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  </label> That Miniſters and Preachers of the Word in executing their Office, and Miniſtery with plainneſſe, and boldneſſe, muſt deliver the Meſſages of God to the people, though they ſeem never ſo harſh or hard, (or rather thus;) That it is the part and duetie of Miniſters to be plain, That it is the part and duetie of Miniſters to be plain, and bold with their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and to tell them of the eſtate and danger that they ſee and diſcern them to be in, upon good grounds without feare or fainting, though their hearers fret, and ſtorme, and flie in their faces, yet they muſt be bold and plain, as in Eſay 58.1. <hi>Crie aloud</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>ſpare not, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, tell my people of their tranſgreſſions, and the Houſe of Iſrael their ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See how earneſt the Lord is, Be thou bold, crie out, and tell my people of their tranſgreſſions, and the danger which they are in by reaſon of their ſinnes, though they be never ſo much incenſed. And in Matthew 3. from the ſeventh to the thirteenth, you ſhall finde that John the Baptiſt dealt thus roundly with the people. <hi>Oh generation of Vipers, a viperous brood, how will ye eſcape the damnation of Hell, and flie from the danger to come?</hi> And he telleth them, unleſſe they did repent, and bring forth fruits worthie amendment of their lives, and had better footing and ground for their comfort then this, that they were the Children of Abraham by Nature, he telleth them that they ſhould be as rotten and fruitleſſe trees, and ſhould be hewen down with the Axe of Gods vengeance, and throwne into the fire.</p>
               <p>Nay, they ſhould be as chaffe burnt with unquenchable fire; thus alſo dealt the Apoſtle Peter with Simon Magus, Acts 8.22, 23. Simon Magus would by the power of conferring the Holy Ghoſt upon others with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but Peter ſaith unto him, Oh repent of this, and pray God if it be poſſible that the very thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven thee, for I ſay thou art in the gall of bitterneſſe, and in the bond of iniquitie, and thy caſe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:108302:116"/> is fearful and damnable, and thou haſt neither part nor fellowſhip in this work; and thus Miniſters of the Word are to do (in their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word) with their hearers and people, and to tell them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and boldly, the eſtate and danger in which they diſcern them to be, upon good ground, though their hearers be incenſed and inraged againſt them.</p>
               <p>Becauſe God requireth it, and the Office of the Miniſtry it ſelf calleth <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1:</label> for this duty, for God hath made his Miniſters Watch-men, and given them the overſight of his people, Heb. 5.17. And alſo in Ezek. 33.7. the Lord ſaith unto his Prophet, <hi>O Son of man, I have made thee a watch-man, thou ſhalt receive the word at my mouth, and admoniſh my people. And if I ſay unto a wicked man, O wicked man, thou ſhalt dye the death, and if the watch-man do not give him warning, and admoniſh him of the danger, he ſhall dye in his iniquity, but his blood ſhall be required at thy hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe plain and bold dealing in the preaching of the Word, is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uſe; it ſtirreth up, and quickeneth mens attention, it helps the underſtanding, and maketh them the ſooner underſtand, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perceive; yea (with the bleſſing of God) this plain and bold deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it hammereth the heart, and worketh upon the Conſcience, it doth leave a wonderful deep impreſſion in the ſoules of men, and it ſtoppeth the mouthes of men, that they have nothing to ſay for themſelves; ſo that it is the duty of Miniſters to be plain and bold in preaching the Word: for Application,</p>
               <p>How far ſhort then are thoſe Miniſters and Preachers of the Word, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> that do flatter and ſooth up men in their ſinnes, and lull them aſleep in their carnal ſecurity, and will never come near them to tell them of their ſinnes, unleſſe it be in a general manner, all along, and never come to inſtance in particular ſinnes. No, they are afraid of offending, and of angering their hearers: Yea, there are many who are juſtly to be taxed, that doe not onely Lull men in their ſinnes, but doe encourage men in a courſe of evil, and ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked, Jer. 23.19. ſo as that they cannot return.</p>
               <p>As for example, Doe not not ſome Miniſters and Preachers of the Word, tell men they need not be ſo ſtrict in obſerving and keeping the Sabbath, as from Morning to Evening, and after that repetition; what need all this adoe, to be ſo ſtrict, and ſo nice in their ordinary Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, as not to ſwear by faith and troth; what? theſe are nice things, they themſelves will doe this; and (ſay they) there is no ſuch danger, as theſe fooliſh, fantaſtical, and puritanical Preachers will make you believe; they will tell you, you are in danger of hell fire for breaking the Sabbath, and ſwearing by Faith and Troth, but there is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Theſe are they whom the Lord complaineth of, in Jer. 6.15. They lead the daughters of my people with ſweet words, and ſay peace, peace, all is well, when there is no ſuch matter, when they are ready to be ſwallowed up of the devil. And as the ſame Prophet ſaith in Jer. 14.13. When the true Prophets did come and threaten ſword and famine upon the people, the falſe Prophets come and tell them they ſhall have no ſuch thing; ſuch Miniſters and Preachers are odious and hatefull in the ſight of God, Jer. 23.14. Theſe daubing and ſoothing Preachers, the Lord ſaith he will feed them with Wormwood, and they ſhall drink of the water of gall; yea (if the Lord doe not give them repentance,) they ſhall one day drink of the deep Cup of his vengeance, in the pit of Deſtruction, in hell.</p>
               <p>But (to paſſe by that) if we that are Miniſters of the Word muſt thus tell our people of their ſinnes, Then our Hearers muſt be content
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108302:117"/> to bee plainly dealt withal, and to be told of their danger; they muſt have their lives ript up, and their ſinnes diſplayed, and their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ranſacked and rifled, and their danger laid open, and men muſt not rage, nor flye in the faces of their Miniſter; Drunkards, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, uncivil ſhag-hair'd, and Civil honeſt perſons, they muſt be told of their eſtate, and that (ſo long as they remain therein) they are in danger of hell and deſtruction; and unleſſe they repent, the Lord will one day come againſt them in vengeance, and they ſhall be as thornes bound up in a bundle, and as Drunkards in their drunkenneſſe, and as ſtubble ready dryed for the fire, Nahum 1.10. <hi>For while they be folden to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as thornes, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they ſhall be devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as ſtubble fully dry.</hi> And thou muſt not be offended, if a man ſhould come and tell thee that fire hath took hold of thy houſe, and unleſſe thou make ſpeed to quench it, it will burn thy houſe to the ground, wilt thou be angry with him? And ſhall the Miniſters and Preachers of Gods Word; ſtand, and cry, Fire, fire, fire, yea the fire of Gods wrath and vengeance, (which is kindled with the breath of the Lord, as a river of brimſtone;) ſhall he, I ſay, thus cry out, The fire of hell is ready to burn thy ſoul and body? and wilt thou be angry with him? Oh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, with whom art thou offended? ſurely with God, for God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, and art thou offended and angry with God? whence cometh it? it cometh from thy own vile Corruptions, helped forward by the Devil.</p>
               <p>Oh then (to conclude) learn then whatſoever thou art, with patience to hear the Word of juſt reproof, and to hear thy faults reprehended; for it is the beſt good that a Preacher can do to thy ſoul, to bring thee out of the ſnare of the devil, unto amendment of life, that thy ſoul may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved eternally in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</p>

Now what were the Children of Iſrael? they were the ſeed of Abraham, deſcended of the holy Patriarks, a very honourable people, yea they were Gods people, his peculiar people, they had the Law, the Temple, the Sacrifices, the ſervice of God amongſt them, yet the Prophet telleth theſe people, that though their Number were as the ſand on the Sea-ſhore, yet a Remnant ſhall be ſaved; and this the Prophet doth, to ſhake the hypocrites amongſt them, who going on in exceeding great impenitency, boaſted themſelves that they were of the ſeed of Abraham, and that God had fulfilled his promiſe in them, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them a great multitude, and therefore the Lord loved them. Now the Prophet he ſheweth, that this was a vain brag, and notwithſtanding their great number, this will not help them, nor avail them in the caſe of ſalvation; this was the general thing intended by the Apoſtle. Now from hence ariſeth two Propoſitions to be obſerved; the firſt is this,</p>
                  <p>That a great Number of people may bear the name of Gods people, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                     </label> and yet but a few of them have true repentance; (or put it down poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,) that Multitudes of people may bear the name of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and have the true Worſhip of God amongſt them ordinarily, and commonly, and yet but a few of thoſe be true repentant ſinners, and in the eſtate of grace, and of ſalvation: this Propoſition hath ground and footing in other places of Scripture, Gen. 6.1, 2. When men began to multiply upon the face of the earth, then the Text ſaith, they ran on in ſinne, together with the multiplication of men and women upon the earth; there was a multiplication of evil, and ſinne, a great number of ſinnes; yea the Sonnes of God, the godly and righteous ſeed, ſuch as were the Worſhippers of the true God, they began to degenerate, and to run on in ſinne. And the Apoſtle Peter ſaith in his firſt Epiſtle, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter, and fifth verſe, that there was onely Noah, and ſeven other with him, who was the Preacher of righteouſneſſe, were ſaved, and the world of ungodly had the deluge brought upon them; and in the firſt verſe of the ſame Chapter, he telleth them, that there ſhould falſe teachers ariſe; and then in the ſecond Verſe he ſaith, many ſhall follow after them, as we ſee in woful experience, let an Anabaptiſt, or Familiſt ariſe, and you ſhall ſee multitudes follow after their damnable wayes, and ſpeak evil of the way of truth, in Matth. 7.13, 14. Chriſt telleth us of a multitude, and an heap of people, which enter in at the wide gate, and broad way, that leadeth to deſtruction, but few there are that find the narrow wicket, and ſtrait way that leadeth to ſalvation, ſo that a multitude of people may bear the name of Gods people, and yet few are true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſinners; and why ſo?</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the Spirit ſaith, Matth. 20.16. <hi>Many are called, but few are <label type="milestone">

'twere nigh a thouſand to one: ſo that it is a certain truth, That a multitude of people may have the true worſhip of God, and yet few of them repent, and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>How abſurd and groſſe is it then, for the Papiſt to ſtand ſo much as they doe upon their number and multitude, for the grounding of their Religion: Multitudes, ſay they, follow our Religion, therefore it is the true Religion; this is but a weak, and an unſound ground, for men to build Religion upon Multitudes; yea in all Societies, in all Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and Families, for the moſt part, the greateſt number is the worſt number; and therefore to ſay their Church is the true Church, becauſe multitudes flock unto it, is a mere ſhadow without ſubſtance; but to leave them.</p>
